title = {Separations coupled with NMR detection},
abstract = {Understanding contaminant fate requires knowledge of the mechanisms by which a compound is degraded, including the rate at which it is transformed as well as the structures of the various products produced. This need to identify and characterize contaminant-transformation products at the molecular level introduces a number of unique analytical challenges. Because of the high information content provided by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, it is an attractive method for the study of contaminant transformation, especially when combined with analysis by mass spectrometry (MS). The versatility of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-NMR makes it a robust and efficient method for the identification of components of complex mixtures, such as those encountered in the study of environmental contaminants. The role of HPLC-NMR as a tool for environmental analyses is discussed and its utility is illustrated by examples from our work to understand the transformation of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic, ciprofloxacin. Recent technological advances to improve sensitivity, such as the coupling of sample concentration by capillary (cITP), allow NMR spectroscopy to play an increasingly important role in studies of the fate of emerging contaminants.

title = {Spectral similarity versus structural similarity: mass spectrometry},
abstract = {A recently described method [Anal. Chim. Acta 490 (2003) 313] for the evaluation of spectral similarity searches has been applied to low resolution mass spectra. Aim of the method is to measure the similarity between the chemical structures of query compounds and the chemical structures of the found reference compounds (hits). A high structural similarity is desirable if the query is not present in the spectral library. Similarity of chemical structures has been measured by the Tanimoto index, calculated from 1365 binary substructure descriptors. The method has been applied to sets of 200-10,000 hitlists obtained with different search methods from a database containing 106,955 compounds. Hitlists with highest structure information have been obtained by using a similarity measure based on the correlation coefficient computed either from spectral features, or from the cubic root of peak intensities for masses up to 200. Frequency distributions of spectral and structural similarities have been investigated and a threshold for the spectral similarity has been derived that in general yields hitlists with structures that are very similar to the query structure. An example compares different search methods. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. [References: 43]},

title = {Masp - a Program Predicting Mass Spectra of Combinatorial Libraries},
abstract = {MASP, a program predicting fragmentation-free mass spectra of libraries prepared by combinatorial synthesis, is presented. MASP combines user-defined building blocks with a nonvariable core molecule and calculates isotopically resolved mass spectra. Peak overlap and the abundance of major and minor isotope peaks can be examined interactively and read from a color display of the spectrum. Further, MASP exhaustively screens a Meta-Library Space to identify libraries with minimum peak overlap and maximum diversity. Diversity can be defined by the user, e.g., as size, hydrophobicity, or hydrogen bonding capability. The usefulness of such a screen for the design of libraries is demonstrated for meso-substituted tetraphenylporphyrins and peptides with a meta-library space of up to 3080 libraries and 625 compounds per library. The program operates on a PC platform under MS Windows 95. It may be useful for drug discovery and optimization studies that employ methods of combinatorial synthesis and mass spectrometry-guided in vitro selection. [References: 16]},

abstract = {3-Pyridyl ethers are excellent nAChRs ligands, which show high subtype selectivity and binding affinity to alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR. Although the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of nAChRs ligands has been widely investigated using various classes of compounds, the open ring analogues of 3-pyridyl ethers have been less involved in these studies due to the greater flexibility of this kind of molecule. In this study, two three-dimensional QSAR techniques and one two-dimensional QSAR technique were used to correlate the molecular structure with the biological activity of 64 analogues of 3-pyridyl ethers. Three different QSAR models were established. Their performances in the QSAR studies of open ring analogues of 3-pyridyl ethers were evaluated by the statistical values in the corresponding models. All models exhibited satisfactory predictive power. Of these models, the HQSAR behaved optimally in terms of the statistical values with q(2) = 0.845, r(2) = 0.897. Finally, graphic interpretation of three different models provided coincident information about the interaction of the ligand-receptor complex and supplied useful guidelines for the synthesis of novel, potent ligands.

abstract = {Internet technology offers an excellent opportunity for the development of tools by the cooperative effort of various groups and institutions. We have developed a multi-platform software system, Virtual Computational Chemistry Laboratory, http://www.vcclab.org, allowing the computational chemist to perform a comprehensive series of molecular indices/properties calculations and data analysis. The implemented software is based on a three-tier architecture that is one of the standard technologies to provide client-server services on the Internet. The developed software includes several popular programs, including the indices generation program, DRAGON, a 3D structure generator, CORINA, a program to predict lipophilicity and aqueous solubility of chemicals, ALOGPS and others. All these programs are running at the host institutes located in five countries over Europe. In this article we review the main features and statistics of the developed system that can be used as a prototype for academic and industry models.},

The current paper describes in detail two major modules of the language: the composition and connectivity modules. which provide a representation of chemical structure. These modules are created using simple hierarchical principles based on ASCII codes and are unique except for stereoisomers and a few special cases (e.g., valence isomers, knot-type compounds). The MCDL also provides for additional information (such as atom coordinates, bond orders, spectra, and physical-chemical characteristics) to be included as a set of supplementary modules.

title = {Substructure, subgraph, and walk counts as measures of the complexity of graphs and molecules},
abstract = {In discussions of unsaturated compounds represented by multigraphs it is necessary to distinguish between the notions of substructure and subgraph. Here the difference is explained and exemplified, and a computer program is introduced which for the first time is able to construct and count all substructures and subgraphs for a colored multigraph (a molecular compound which may contain unsaturation and heteroatoms). Construction of all substructures and subgraphs is computationally demanding; therefore, two alternatives are pointed out for the treatment of large sets of compounds: (i) Often it will suffice to consider counts of substructures/subgraphs up to a certain number of edges only, information which is provided by the program much more rapidly. (ii) It is shown that information equivalent to that gained from substructure or subgraph counts is often far more easily available using walk counts. Some problems and their consequences for substructure/subgraph/walk counts are discussed that arise from the models used in organic chemistry for certain compounds such as aromatics and from the necessity to express qualitative features of molecular structures numerically.

The present paper discusses an extension this concept to higher-valence centers. Methods for counting and generating all stereoisomers are provided. Moreover, for some types of isomers algorithms for constructing spatial realizations geometrically are presented. The main mathematical tool is the theory of group and double cosets.

abstract = {Computational power, speed, and algorithmic complexity are increasing at a continuing rate. As a result, scientific simulations continue to investigate more and more complex systems. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is no exception. NMR theory and language is extremely well developed, that simulations have become a standard by which experiments are measured. Nowadays, complex computations can be performed on normal workstations and workstation clusters. Basic numerical operations have also become extremely optimized and new computer language paradigms have become implemented. Currently there exists no complete NMR tool kit which uses these newer techniques. This paper describes such a tool kit, BlochLib. BlochLib is designed to be the next generation of NMR simulation packages; however, the basic techniques implemented are applicable to almost any problem. BlochLib enables the user to simulate almost any NMR idea both experimental or theoretical in nature. Both classical and quantum mechanical techniques are included and demonstrated, as well as several powerful user interface tools.

abstract = {Different Virtual screening techniques are available as alternatives to high throughput screening. These different techniques have been rarely used together on the same target. We had the opportunity to do so in order to discover novel blockers of the voltage-dependent potassium channel Kv1.5, a potential target for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Our corporate database was searched, using a protein-based pharmacophore, derived from a homology model, as query. As a result, 244 molecules were screened in vitro, 19 of them (7.8%) were found to be active. Five of them, belonging to five different chemical classes, exhibited IC50 values under 10 mu M. The performance of this structure-based virtual screening protocol has been compared with those of similarity and ligand-based pharmacophore searches. The analysis of the results supports the conventional wisdom Of using as many virtual screening techniques as possible in order to maximize the chance of finding as many chemotypes as possible.

title = {The role of ionic backbones in rna structure - an unusually stable non-watson-crick duplex of a nonionic analog in an apolar medium},
abstract = {The solution structure of a dimethylenesulfone-linked analogue of the RNA dimer UpC was determined using two-dimensional NMR and restrained molecular dynamics. In CDCl3, the RNA analogue forms a parallel duplex with a single U:U base pair and roughly antiparallel orientation of the two ribose rings within each strand. A hydrogen bonding network stabilizing this duplex was indirectly deduced from the NMR data. Besides the two-pronged hydrogen bonding between the uridines, this network includes two hydrogen bonds from the ribose hydroxyls of one strand to O2 of the cytosine bases of the opposite strand, and intrastrand hydrogen bonds from the 2' hydroxyls of the 5'-terminal residues to hydroxyls of the 3'-terminal residue. The melting point of the duplex determined via NMR chemical shift analysis was found to be 91 degrees C for a 11 mM solution in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d(2). Based on van't Hoff analysis of the available UV melting data in 1,2-dichloroethane, duplex formation is associated with a Delta S degrees of -47 cal K-1 mol(-1) and a Delta H degrees of -22 kcal mol(-1). The observation that an RNA analogue rendered nonionic and removed from an aqueous environment forms an exceptionally stable non-Watson-Crick duplex with backbone-to-nucleobase and backbone-to-backbone hydrogen bonds suggests that a charged backbone and the solubility in aqueous medium that it conveys are important for limiting the repertoire of strand-strand interactions of oligoribonucleotides.

title = {Ligand-target interactions: What can we learn from NMR?},
abstract = {The conformation of the ligand in complex with a macromolecular target can be studied by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in solution for both tightly and weakly forming complexes. In the weak binding regime (k(off) > 10(4) Hz), the structure of the bound ligand is accessible also for very large complexes (> 100 kDa), which are not amenable to NMR studies in the tight binding regime. Here I review the state-of-the-art NMR methodology used for screening ligands and for the structural investigation of bound ligand conformations, in both tight and weak binding regimes. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are critically described. The NMR methodology used to investigate transiently forming complexes has expanded considerably in the past few years, opening new possibilities for a detailed description of ligand-target interactions. Novel methods for the determination of the bound ligand conformation, in particular transferred cross-correlated relaxation, are thoroughly reviewed, and their advantages with respect to established methodology are discussed, using the epothilone-tubulin complex as a primary example.

The geometries of the involved species were optimized at the PM3, HF, B3LYP and mPW1PW91 levels whereas the C-13 NMR parameters were determined at the HF, B3LYP and mPW1PW91 levels. Different combinations of basis sets were also tested. The consistency and efficiency of the considered combinations of geometry optimizations and GIAO C-13 NMR calculations were thoroughly checked by the analysis of statistical parameters concerning computed and experimental C-13 NMR chemical shift values.

title = {Prediction of three-dimensional molecular structures using information from infrared spectra},
abstract = {A method has been developed for obtaining the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a molecule directly from the information in an infrared spectrum. By training a counterpropagation network with 3D structures and IR spectra it is possible to simulate the structure code of a query spectrum. To obtain an initial structure, the simulated code is compared with structure codes generated from a database of over 100,000 molecules. The molecule with the most similar structure code defines die so-called initial model for the 3D structure. By means of stochastic methods, this initial structure is modified in various ways to gain the best similarity with the structure code from the neural network. Thus, information from infrared spectra can be used to generate the corresponding 3D structure. The scopes and limitations of the method will be discussed with different examples of compounds using experimental IR spectra from various applications. The intention of this method is to assist in the interpretation of IR and in structure elucidation in routine analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. [References: 21]},

(5) GPI-anchored membrane, and (6) peripheral membrane. Situated in a heteropolar environment, these six types of membrane proteins must have quite different amphiphilic sequence-order patterns in order to stabilize their respective frameworks. To incorporate such a feature into the predictor, the amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition has been formulated that contains a series of hydrophobic and hydrophilic correlation factors. The Success rates thus obtained have been remarkably enhanced in identifying the types of membrane proteins, as demonstrated by the jackknife test and independent data set test, respectively.

abstract = {The automated structure elucidation of organic molecules from experimentally obtained properties is extended by an entirely new approach. A genetic algorithm is implemented that uses molecular constitution structures as individuals. With this approach, the structure of organic molecules can be optimized to meet experimental criteria, if in addition a fast and accurate method for the prediction of the used physical or chemical features is available. This is demonstrated using C-13 NMR spectrum as readily obtainable information. C-13 NMR chemical shift, intensity, and multiplicity information is available from C-13 NMR DEPT spectra. By means of artificial neural networks a fast and accurate method for calculating the C-13 NMR spectrum of the generated structures exists. The approach is limited by the size of the constitutional space that has to be searched and by the accuracy of the shift prediction for the unknown substance. The method is implemented and tested successfully for organic molecules with up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms. [References: 27]},

title = {Molecular similarity analysis and virtual screening by mapping of consensus positions in binary-transformed chemical descriptor spaces with variable dimensionality},
abstract = {A novel compound classification algorithm is described that operates in binary molecular descriptor spaces and groups active compounds together in a computationally highly efficient manner. The method involves the transformation of continuous descriptor value ranges into a binary format, subsequent definition of simplified descriptor spaces, identification of consensus positions of specific compound sets in these spaces, and iterative adjustments of the dimensionality of the descriptor spaces in order to discriminate compounds sharing similar activity from others. We term this approach Dynamic Mapping of Consensus positions (DMC) because the definition of reference spaces is tuned toward specific compound classes and their dimensionality is increased as the analysis proceeds. When applied to virtual screening, sets of bait compounds are added to a large screening database to identify hidden active molecules. In these calculations, molecules that map to consensus positions after elimination of most of the database compounds are considered hit candidates. In a benchmark study on five biological activity classes, hits for randomly assembled sets of bait molecules were correctly identified in 95% of virtual screening calculations in a source database containing more than 1.3 million molecules, thus providing a measure of the sensitivity of the DMC technique.

title = {Connectivities in molecules by INADEQUATE: recent developments},
abstract = {The INADEQUATE (Incredible Natural Abundance DoublE QUAntum Transfer Experiment) consists of a pulse sequence which eliminates the NMR signals from isolated spins (spin system A) displaying signals from coupled spins (spin system AX or higher spin systems). It is of great importance when applied to molecules with skeleton elements such as carbon, silicon or tungsten, all of which contain a small percentage of spin-1/2 isotopes embedded in magnetically inactive isotopes. Analysis of the AX type spectra gives one-bond and long-range coupling constants (see compound 6) and, most important, the connectivity pattern of the skeleton atoms in molecules of unknown structure such as the carbon compounds 1 or 2, the silicon compound 3 or the lithium compound 4b. Unfortunately, INADEQUATE is rather insensitive, in the case of carbon only one out of 104 molecules gives the desired response. Efforts to reduce this drawback are described; recently, a remarkable step forward has been made by concentrating the four lines of an AX spin system to just two signals (see Fig. 2).

Databases of estimated spectra are deduced from a small set of assigned structures using HOSE codes. Using spectra estimated from structures circumvents problems of inconsistent, incomplete, missing or irrelevant data. It also enables rapid of reasonably sized databases that are unavailable from commercial sources. We validate the similarity method theoretically by analyzing what can be best expected from a match of an estimated set of peaks to the experimental spectrum. We also show by example that the method is successful when used in the laboratory. [References: 24]},

title = {Improving the odds in discriminating "Drug-like" from "Non Drug-like" compounds},
abstract = {We have used a feed-forward neural network technique to classify chemical compounds into potentially "drug-like" and "non drug-like" candidates. The neural network was trained to distinguish between a set of "drug-like" and "non drug-like" chemical compounds taken from the MACCS-II Drug Data Report (MDDR) and the Available Chemicals Directory (ACD). The 2D atom types (of the full atomic representation) were assigned and applied as descriptors to encode numerically each There are four main conclusions: First the method performs well, correctly assigning 88% of the compounds in both MDDR and ACD. discrimination was achieved by a more critical selection of training sets. Second, the method gives much better prediction performance than the widely used "Rule of Five", which accepts as many as 74% of the compounds but only 66% of those in MDDR, resulting in a correlation coefficient which is effectively zero, compared to a value of 0.63 for the neural network prediction. Third, based on a standard Tanimoto similarity search the selection of drug-like compounds in the set is not biased toward compounds similar to those in the training Fourth, the trained neural network was applied to evaluate the drug-likeness of 136 GABA uptake inhibitors with impressive results. implications of applying a neural network to characterize chemical compounds are discussed.

abstract = {Several ab initio and density functional theory computations were performed on PC-UNIX machines with the GAUSSIAN 94 program to compare the utilized central processing unit (CPU) time with workstations and supercomputers. The performance of the Intel PentiumPro 200 CPU was about half to one-fifth the speed of high-level workstations for most types of computations. Utilizing the RAM DISK feature developed in the Linux operating system, we assigned the scratch files to be processed in the main memory; the total CPU utilization of small jobs, such as Hartree-Fock calculations, showed little difference from the calculation where the scratch files were processed in the magnetic disk. The result indicates that the I/O architecture of the PC is not the main bottleneck for nongigantic computation. Using a PC with Intel PentiumPro 200 CPU to run the electronic structure calculation can be at worst 12 times slower than using a fast superscalar model, such as the SGI PowerChallenge R8000, while processing the geometry optimization for formyl cyanide at the MP2/6-311G** level of theory. Nevertheless, PCs finish the jobs within reasonable time for the majority of the tested cases. Considering the ratio of price-performance, the PC is an attractive alternative platform for certain types of electronic structure calculations.},

title = {Holographic neural networks as nonlinear discriminants for chemical applications},
abstract = {A holographic neural network has been investigated for use as a discriminant. Six sets of artificial data and two data sets of infrared spectra, reduced using principal component analysis, of prepared cervical smears were analyzed by four regular discriminant methods as well as by the holographic neural network method. In all cases, it was found that the holographic neural network method gave comparable, and in some cases superior, results to the other discriminant methods. The holographic neural network method is simple to apply and has the advantage that it can be easily refined when new data become available without disturbing the original mapping. It is suggested that the holographic neural network method should be seriously considered when discrimination methods need to be applied.},

abstract = {Prediction of protein folding rates from amino acid sequences is one of the most important challenges in molecular biology. In this work, I have related the protein folding rates with physical-chemical, energetic and conformational properties of amino acid residues. I found that the classification of proteins into different structural classes shows an excellent correlation between amino acid properties and folding rates of two- and three-state proteins, indicating the importance of native state topology in determining the protein folding rates. I have formulated a simple linear regression model for predicting the protein folding rates from amino acid sequences along with structural class information and obtained an excellent agreement between predicted and experimentally observed folding rates of proteins; the correlation coefficients are 0.99, 0.96 and 0.95, respectively, for all-alpha, all-beta and mixed class proteins. This is the first available method, which is capable of predicting the protein folding rates just from the amino acid sequence with the aid of generic amino acid properties and structural class information.

title = {Search for new lead compounds from higher plants},
abstract = {Higher plants represent a rich source of new molecules with pharmacological properties, which are lead compounds for the development of new drugs. During the last decades, the renewed interest in investigating natural products has led to the advent of several important drugs, such as the anticancer substances vinblastine, vincristine and taxol, or the antimalarial agent artemisinin. Success in natural products reasearch is conditioned by a careful plant selection, based on various criteria such as chemotaxonomic data, information from traditional medicine, field observations or even random collection. One main strategy in the isolation of new leads consists of the so-called bioactivity-guided isolation, in which pharmacological or biological assays are used to target the isolation of bioactive compounds. One major drawback of this strategy is the frequent isolation of known metabolites. Therefore, hyphenated techniques (LC-UV/DAD, LC-MS, LC-NMR) have been developed, in order to detect as early as possible potential original structures. These compounds can then be tested in various bioassays. Using a combination of hyphenated techniques and bioactivity-guided isolation procedures, a series of new diterpenoic antifungal quinones have been isolated from the African tree, Bobgunnia madagascariensis (Leguminosae) and recently patented for their strong activity and for their potential use in the treatment of systemic mycoses.

abstract = {To meet the ever increasing demands on quality and efficiency of spectroscopic services an entirely new approach to fully automated structure elucidation has been developed.(1) SpecSolv, as this program was titled, represents a new module for the multidimensional spectroscopic interpretation system SpecInfo. SpecSolv is a self-learning, artificially intelligent system based exclusively on C-13-NMR chemical shift, intensity and multiplicity information which is readily available from C-13-NMR-DEPT spectra. Unlike other structure generators, SpecSolv does not require any additional input from further spectroscopic techniques or even the knowledge of the molecular formula of the unknown. Using a dedicated data base of subspectra-substructure correlations (SSC) and a novel assembly algorithm, SpecSolv is capable of elucidating structures from most organic molecules (C, H, N, O, S, P, X) up to a molecular weight of about 1000 Da in only minutes of computing time.

These can be associated either with specific nodes in the XML document or with the entire document. We illustrate this with two examples. An entire journal article expressed in XML has its individual components digitally signed by separate authors, and the collection is placed in an envelope and again signed. The second example involves using a software robot agent to acquire a collection of documents from a specified URL, to perform various operations and transformations on the content, including expressing molecules in CML, and to automatically sign the various components and deposit the result in a repository. We argue that these operations can used as components for building what we term an authenticated and semantic chemical web of trust.},

title = {Unknown identification using reference mass spectra. Quality of databases},
abstract = {The high success of the "uncertified" mass spectrometry spectral collection started in 1956 demonstrated qualitatively that a partial reference mass spectrum, even one measured routinely, can be of real value. Correct matchings were still possible despite reference errors, which almost never led to close matches that were incorrect. This shows quantitatively that the number of different compounds, not the number of peaks in a spectrum, is by far the most important of database efficiency for identifying a "global" unknown. A evaluation of matching performance shows that only 6, 12, and 18 peaks a reference spectrum are 13%, 67%, and 96%, respectively, as valuable hundreds of peaks. Also, a separately measured second spectrum of the same compound is 50% as valuable as the first. Database expansion that tripled the number of possible wrong answers only reduced the of correct identifications by 5%. Corrections of a mass or abundance error in each of six reference spectra increase the database matching performance by as much as the addition of one spectrum of a new A new "matching quality index" based statistically on these values indicates that the largest database is also by far the most effective matching unknowns.

We were able to drastically improve the recent result by Byvatov et al. (2003) on this task and achieved an error rate of about 7% on unseen compounds using Support Vector Machines. We see a very high potential of such machine learning techniques for a variety of computational chemistry problems that occur in the drug discovery and drug design process. [References: 25]},

title = {Solution structure of the aminoacyl-capped oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplex (W-TGCGCAC)(2)},
abstract = {Reported here is the solution structure of the aminoacyl-DNA duplex (W-TGCGCAC)(2). This duplex forms a continuously pi-stacked helix consisting of both nucleobases and amino acid side chains. According to NMR and UV analyses, the duplex melts in a cooperative transition and with 1.3-1.8% greater hyperchromicity than the control duplex (TGCGCAC)(2). A van't Hoff analysis of UV melting points at different concentrations shows that the two tryptophan residues contribute 4.8 kcal/mol to the Delta H degrees of complex formation at 10 mM salt concentration and less than 1 kcal/mol at 150 mM I salt. The entropic cost for duplex association in the presence of the amino acid residues is 13 cal/molK greater than that for the control at 10 mM salt concentration, and 3 cal/molK lower than that of the control at 0.15 ionic strength. The conformation of W-TGCGCAC in duplex form, determined via restrained torsion angle molecular dynamics, shows an undisturbed B-form DNA duplex with dangling 3'-termini. The tryptophanyl residue at the 5'-terminus packs tightly against T2 and the proximal part of adenine, without engaging in hydrogen bonding. While not providing strong enthalpic net stabilization of the duplex, the tryptophan "cap" on the duplex does seem to reduce the fraying at the termini, indicating a subtle balance of entropic and enthalpic factors contributing to the molecular dynamics. The structure also shows that, at least in the present sequence context, stacking on the terminal base pair is more favorable than intercalation, probably because the enthalpic cost associated with breaking up the stacking between DNA base pairs cannot be paid for by favorable pi-stacking interactions with the indole ring of tryptophan. These results are of importance for understanding stacking interactions in protein-DNA complexes, particularly those in enzyme-substrate complexes involving exposed nucleobases. [References: 69]},

abstract = {The use of numerous descriptors that are indicative of molecular structure is becoming common in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. As all of the descriptors might carry more or less molecular information, it seems more advisable to investigate the possible variable combination rather than variable selection. In this paper, an optimized block-wise variable combination (OBVC) by particle swarm optimization based on partial least squares modeling has been proposed for variable combination. An F statistic is also introduced to determine the dimensionality of the PLS model. The performance is assessed using two QSAR data sets. Experimental results have shown the good performance of this technique compared to those obtained by stepwise regression. [References: 31]},

title = {Can 3D structural parameters be predicted from 2D (topological) molecular descriptors?},
abstract = {The dihedral angle between both phenyl rings determined by photoelectron spectroscopy in a series of seven alkylbiphenyl is described by the local spectral moments of the bond matrix. This series is extended to 78 alkylbiphenyl compounds by estimating the dihedral angle from molecular mechanics force field calculations. The linear correlation obtained between this angle and the local spectral moments shown a correlation coefficient of 0.9838. This result proves that 2D (topological) descriptors can account for 3D structural parameters. A new substituent constant is calculated as the contribution of groups to the studied rotational angle by using the information encoded into the local spectral moments. This substituent constant is not linearly related to the Taft's steric constants Es as they have a correlation coefficient of only 0.75. These steric constants are able to account only for 71% of the variance in the studied 3D parameter. The implications for QSPR/QSAR studies of the demonstration that 2D (topological) descriptors can describe 3D structural parameters are also analyzed. [References: 39]},

abstract = {Automated or semiautomated pattern recognition in multidimensional NMR spectroscopy is strongly hampered by the large number of noise and artifact peaks occurring under practical conditions. A general Bayesian method which is able to assign probabilities that observed peaks are members of given signal classes (e.g., the class of true resonance peaks or the class of noise and artifact peaks) was proposed previously. The discriminative power of this approach is dependent on the choice of the properties characterizing the peaks, The automated class recognition is improved by the addition of a nonlocal feature, the similarities of peak shapes in symmetry-related positions, It turns out that this additional property strongly decreases the overlap of the multivariate probability distributions for true signals and noise and hence largely increases the discrimination of true resonance peaks from noise and artifacts.

By using a knowledge base of chemical shift distributions of the 20 amino acid types, fuzzy mathematics, and pattern recognition theory, the spin coupling topological graphs are mapped onto specific amino acid residues. In this work, we investigated the feasibility of using secondary structure: information of proteins as predicted by neural networks in the automated NMR assignment, As the H-1 and C-13 chemical shifts of proteins are known to correlate to their secondary structures, secondary structure information is useful in improving the amino acid recognition, in this study, the secondary structures of proteins predicted by the PHD protein server and our own trained neural networks are used in the amino acid type recognition, The results show that the predicted secondary structure information can help to improve the accuracy of the amino acid recognition.},

Therefore its extension to cycle containing structures is not unambiguous; there are several possibilities, some of which have already been realized. In this paper, we proposed an ''all-path'' version of W and showed that its maximal value is equal to N-2(N - 1)2(N-4), where N denotes the number of vertices in a graph. In contrast,the maximal values of W and its close analogues, the detour index, w(G), and the Szeged index, Sz(G); are polynomials of order 4 or less in terms of N, and therefore, it may be expected that the new version will discriminate cycle-containing structures more efficiently than W(G), w(G), or Sz(G).},

Progress has primarily been achieved with bacterial proteins, but efforts to solve the structure of eukaryotic membrane proteins are also increasing. Most of the structures currently available have been obtained by exploiting the power of X-ray crystallography. Recent results, however, have demonstrated the accuracy of electron crystallography and the imaging power of the atomic force microscope. These instruments allow membrane proteins to be studied while embedded in the bi-layer, and thus in a functional state. The low signal-to-noise ratio of cryo-electron microscopy is overcome by crystallizing membrane proteins in a two-dimensional protein-lipid membrane, allowing its atomic structure to be determined. In contrast, the high signal-to-noise ratio of atomic force microscopy allows individual protein surfaces to be imaged},

abstract = {A quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) study based on multiple linear regression (MLR) was performed for the description and prediction of Kovats retention indices (RI) of alcohol compounds. Alcohols were of saturated, linear or branched types and contained a hydroxyl group on the primary, secondary or tertiary carbon atoms. Constitutive and weighted holistic invariant molecular (WHIM) descriptors were used to represent the structure of alcohols in the MLR models. Before the model building, five variable selection methods were applied to select the most relevant variables from a large set of descriptors, respectively. The selected molecular properties were included into the MLR models. The efficiency of the variable selection methods was also compared. The selection methods were as follows: ridge regression (RR), Partial least-squares method (PLS), pair-correlation method (PCM), forward selection (FS) and best subset selection (BSS). The stability and the validity of the MLR models were tested by a cross-validation technique using a leave-n-out technique. Neither RR nor PLS selected variables were able to describe the Kovats retention index properly, and PCM gave reliable results in the description but not for prediction. We built models with good predicting ability using FS and BSS as a selection method. The most relevant variables in the description and prediction of RIs were the mean electrotopological state index, the molecular mass, and WHIM indices characterizing size and shape.

abstract = {Pseudo-Rotational Online Service and Interactive Tool (PROSIT) designed to perform complete pseudorotational analysis of nucleosides and nucleotides is described. This service is freely available at http://cactus.nei.nih.gov/prosit/. Files containing nucleosides/nucleotides or DNA/RNA segments, isolated or bound to other molecules (e.g., a protein) can be uploaded to be processed by PROSIT. The service outputs the pseudorotational phase angle P, puckering amplitude v(max), and other related information for each nucleoside/nucleotide detected. The service was implemented using the chemoinformatics tooWt CACTVS. PROSIT was used for a survey of nucleosides contained in the Cambridge Structural Database and nucleotides in high-resolution crystal structures from the Nucleic Acid Database. Special cases discussed include nucleosides having constrained sugar moieties with extreme puckering amplitudes, and several specific DNA/RNA helices and protein-bound DNA oligonucleotides (Dickerson-Drew dodecamer, RNA/DNA hybrid viral plypurine tract, Z-DNA enantiomers, B-DNA containing (L)-alpha-threofuranosyl nucleotides, TATA-box binding protein/TATA-box complex, and DNA (cytosine C5)-methyltransferase complexed with an oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing transition state analogue 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine). When the puckering amplitude decreases to a small value, the sugar becomes increasingly planar, thus reducing the significance of the phase angle P. We introduce the term "central conformation" to describe this part of the pseudorotational hyperspace in contrast to the conventional north and south conformations. [References: 47]},

abstract = {A number of inexpensive computers were benchmarked with the ab initio program Gaussian 94, using both small standard test jobs and larger density functional (DFT) calculations. Several varieties of Pentium (x86) and Alpha CPU based systems were tested. Most of them were running under the open source code operating system Linux. They were compared with several workstations and supercomputers. The most powerful of:today's commodity-type processors surpassed current supercomputers-in speed. The choice of compilers and compilation options was often found to have a larger influence on job CPU times than details of the hardware. Especially on the x86 type machines, the-jobs always ran faster the less memory (RAM) they. were given. The fastest machine on a per-CPU basis was an Alpha/Linux system. For the DFT calculation, it was close to twice as fast as a Cray J90 supercomputer. [References: 12]},

abstract = {A simple database of C-13/H-1-C-13 spectral lists for 11673 natural products was created in standard commercial database format. Over 50% of the spectra were predicted using HOSE code descriptors derived from the 50% of spectra having experimental values. Prediction errors obtained by prediction of and comparison to the experimental spectra revealed an exponentially decaying dependence between the average absolute error and the depth of the matching HOSE codes. A subset of the library containing over 1000 H-1-C-13 assigned experimental spectral lists were used to test against eight alternate query data sets. These sets represent query data from various combinations of 1D-C-13, 1D-DEPT, and 2D-H-1-C-13 spectra. Simulated query lists were generated using Monte Carlo methods. As expected, queries based on 2D-H-1-C-13 data were more likely to find the correct match under unfavorable conditions. [References: 9]},

title = {ZINC - A free database of commercially available compounds for virtual screening},
abstract = {A critical barrier to entry into structure-based virtual screening is the lack of a suitable, easy to access database of purchasable compounds. We have therefore prepared a library of 727 842 molecules, each with 3D structure, using catalogs of compounds from vendors (the size of this library continues to grow). The molecules have been assigned biologically relevant protonation states and are annotated with properties such as molecular weight, calculated LogP, and number of rotatable bonds. Each molecule in the library contains vendor and purchasing information and is ready for docking using a number of popular docking programs. Within certain limits, the molecules are prepared in multiple protonation states and multiple tautomeric forms. In one format, multiple conformations are available for the molecules. This database is available for free download (http://zinc.docking.org) in several common file formats including SMILES, mol2, 3D SDF, and DOCK flexibase format. A Web-based query tool incorporating a molecular drawing interface enables the database to be searched and browsed and subsets to be created. Users can process their own molecules by uploading them to a server. Our hope is that this database will bring virtual screening libraries to a wide community of structural biologists and medicinal chemists. [References: 31]},

Since publication of these protocols developments in spectroscopy have led large number of requests for additions for applications not originally covered. Following careful consideration, it has become apparent that few minor modifications will significantly increase the range of applications.

But unlike Bioinformatics, where data is openly available and freely re-usable, most chemical information is closed and cannot be re-distributed without permission. This has led to a failure to adopt modern informatics and software techniques and therefore paucity of chemistry in bioinformatics. New technology, however, offers the hope of making chemical data (compounds and properties) free during the authoring process. We argue that the technology is already available; we require a collective agreement to enhance publication protocols.},

abstract = {The theory of fuzzy sets was applied to specific infrared spectrum-structure-correlations. The scheme was translated into a rule base named CorTab (from Correlation Tables). data are split into three main data files consisting of the structural information, the spectral properties and the cross references. The two files contain the fragments and the ranges of the spectroscopic features, i.e. position, intensity and band width, and also the knowledge about the plausibility or constraints of the correlations. cross references assign the spectral to the structural properties and contain the connections between the fragments in the network of the fragments. The flexibility of the design allows the ongoing of spectrum-structure-correlations from different literature sources or the storage of computer derived rules. The rule base CorTab is a prerequisite for the structure elucidation performed by an ensemble of interpretation systems relying on fuzzy logic. A survey of the arrangement and contents of the rule base and the procedures that transform the verbally given knowledge into linguistic - fuzzified - variables are reported herein.

abstract = {In this work the calculated nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (NQCC; X) of O-17 in artemisinin and some of its derivatives and the effects of charge density due to the nature of ligands on NQCC of O-17 were investigated. All calculations were performed at the HF/3-21G level using the Gaussian 98 program. The results show that the O-O linkage has a characteristic role in the antimalarial activity of artemisinin. In addition, various substitutions on C4 change the charge density on these oxygens and consequently change the pharmaceutical effect of artemisinin. Our results suggest that due to a larger charge density on O1, the heme iron approaches the endoperoxide moiety at the O1 position with preference to the O2 position. [References: 25]},

Instruments are mature enough to run large sequences of samples; novel advancements increase the breadth of compounds that can be analyzed, and improved algorithms and databases are employed to capture and utilize biologically relevant information. Around half the published reports on metabolite profiling by GC-MS focus on biological problems rather than on methodological advances. Applications span from comprehensive analysis of volatiles to assessment of metabolic fluxes for bioengineering. Method improvements emphasize extraction procedures, evaluations of quality control of GC-MS in comparison to other techniques and approaches to data processing. Two major challenges remain: rapid annotation of unknown peaks; and, integration of biological background knowledge aiding data interpretation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The stereochemical environment of each carbon atom of a data set of steroids with assigned chemical shifts was encoded and atoms of similar environment were grouped into clusters. Management of errors and optimization of the methods' parameters in order to obtain the best results in chemical shift predictions were handled by special routines. The predicted chemical shifts of unknown compounds were matched against the values observed on the experimental spectra to calculate a degree of support index. It is shown that this index can be used to reject bad structures proposed by structure generators in the task of structure elucidation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A database of 206 nucleosides has been selected from the literature and a theoretical virtual screening model has been developed. The model is able of discriminating between compounds that have anti-HIV activity and those that do not, with a good classification level of 85% in the training and 82.8% in the crossvalidation series. On the basis of the information generated by the model, the correct classification of practically 80% of compounds from an external prediction set has been achieved using the theoretical model. Furthermore, the contribution of a range of molecular fragments to the pharmacological action has been calculated and this could provide a powerful tool in the design of nucleoside analogues that show activity against the HIV. Finally, a QSAR model has been developed that allows quantitative data to be obtained regarding the pharmacological potency shown by this type of compound. [References: 97]},

The training set consisted of 744 examples of protons that were represented by physicochemical, topological, and geometric descriptors. The selection of descriptors was performed by genetic algorithms, and the models obtained were compared to those containing all the descriptors. The best models yielded very good predictions for an independent prediction set of 259 cases (mean absolute error for whole set, 0.25 ppm; mean absolute error for 90% of cases, 0.19 ppm) and for application cases consisting of four natural products recently described. Some stereochemical effects could be correctly predicted. A useful feature of the system resides in its ability to be retrained with a specific data set of compounds if improved predictions for related structures are required. [References: 54]},

title = {Generalized fragment-substructure based property prediction method},
abstract = {The need for fast and accurate predictors of pharmaceutically important properties has been increasing due to pressure from high-throughput screening, in-silico screening, and the need to more rapidly identify potential pharmacokinetic issues before drugs advance to the more expensive clinical development stages. A novel method for making predictive models based on decomposing 2D structure into component structural fragments is used to model logP, water solubility, and melting point. The fragment orientation of the method facilitates understanding of how molecules might be altered to improve the desired properties. The 2D structure-based descriptor is computed by analysis of the target molecules with a substructure searching algorithm and a set of fragments selected for chemical and pharmaceutical relevance. These are combined with partial least squares to create predictive models. The correlation coefficients achieved are 0.86 for logP (SE = 0.68), 0.73 for logS (SE = 0.89), and 0.64 (SE = 48.9 degrees) for melting point over diverse data sets of 11447, 2427, and 5598 molecules, respectively. The models were verified via test sets of compounds not included in the training set. [References: 42]},

The reporting parameters encompassed by MSI include the biological study design, sample preparation, data acquisition, data processing, data analysis and interpretation relative to the biological hypotheses being evaluated. Herein we exemplify how such metadata can be reported by using a small case study - the metabolite profiling by GC-TOF mass spectrometry of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves from a knockout allele of the gene At1g08510 in the Wassilewskija ecotype. Pitfalls in quality control are highlighted that can invalidate results even if MSI reporting standards are fulfilled, including reliable compound identification and integration of unknown metabolites.

abstract = {We examined the quality of Catalyst's conformational model generation algorithm via a large scale study based on the crystal structures of a sample of 510 pharmaceutically relevant protein-ligand complexes extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Our results show that the tested algorithms implemented within Catalyst are able to produce high quality conformers, which in most of the cases are well suited for in silico drug research. Catalyst-specific settings were analyzed, such as the method used for the conformational model generation (FAST vs BEST) and the maximum number of generated conformers. By setting these options for higher fitting quality, the average RMS values describing the similarity of experimental and simulated conformers were improved from an RMS of 1.06 with max. 50 FAST generated conformers to an RMS of 0.93 with max. 255 BEST generated conformers, which represents an improvement by 12%. Each method provides best fitting conformers with an RMS value < 1.50 in more than 80% of all cases. We analyzed the computing time/quality ratio of various conformational model generation settings and examined ligands in high energy conformations. Furthermore, properties of the same ligands in various proteins were investigated, and the fitting qualities of experimental conformations from the PDB and the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) were compared. One of the most important conclusions of former studies, the fact that bioactive conformers often have energy high above that of Global minima, was confirmed. [References: 26]},

abstract = {NMR spectroscopy has, in many instances, proved to be an important tool for the rapid, non-invasive analysis of liquid foods. However, achieving improved and more complete spectral assignment poses several difficulties due to strong signal overlap and low abundance of many components of interest. This paper presents preliminary applications of diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) to complex liquid foods such as fruit juices and beer, as a complementary aid to spectral assignment based on the hydrodynamic volume, and hence diffusivity of different components. The usefulness of this technique is shown mainly for aliphatic and aromatic compounds found in juices and beer and the difficulties posing challenges for future work are discussed.

abstract = {To avoid side effects, it is often desirable to increase the specificity of a drug candidate when targeting one member of a family of related proteins, whereby one exploits small differences between the structures of the binding sites. Identification of such differences can be carried out by analyzing the distributions of physicochemical properties mapped onto molecular surfaces. Here we demonstrate that SURFCOMP, our local surface similarity detection method, is able to detect differences between the binding sites of two closely related proteins. We analyzed the SH2 domains of Sap and Eat-2, two highly similar signal transduction molecules involved in inflammatory processes and found differences between their binding sites that can possibly lead to a better understanding of the different specificities of the two proteins.

Although natural-product-, rational-drug-design-, and NMR-screening-programs have begun to use flow NMR more routinely, flow NMR has not yet gained widespread acceptance in combinatorial chemistry, even though it has been shown to be a potentially useful tool. Recent developments in DI-NMR, FIA-NMR, and LC-NMR will help flow NMR eventually gain a wider acceptance within combinatorial chemistry. These developments include LC-NMR-MS instrumentation, flow probe improvements, new pulse sequences, improved automation of NMR data analysis, and the application of flow NMR to related fields in drug discovery.

title = {Encoding and decoding graphical chemical structures as two-dimensional (PDF417) barcodes},
abstract = {A wide range of molecular representations exist today, ranging from human-readable structural diagrams over line notations such as Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN) and SMILES to several dozen computer-readable file formats. Still, to encode molecular structures in a computer-readable way for inputting structures in computer systems those formats are not the method of choice since they are not easily and faultlessly readable via optical recognition. In the present study a two-dimensional (PDF417) barcode representation of molecular structures in SMILES format is explored that enables the user to read and input molecular structures into computer systems in a fully automated fashion. A Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) based compressed version of SMILES is suggested for cases where the size of the structure exceeds the storage capacity of PDF417 barcodes. Alternatively, the compact ACS format may be employed as a structural representation. The input via barcodes is fast, practically error free due to the 2D barcodes used which employ error correction and fully automatic. A Web application interface is developed which is able to interpret these barcodes and export them as optimized 3D chemical structures. Applications of this representation range from keeping automated storage systems to Web-based tracking systems of molecular samples. The National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, employs 2D barcode encoded structures for in-house repository management, where barcodes can also be used for querying the database for similar or substructures of the query structure.},

abstract = {A method is presented for perceiving chemical types of atoms in molecules given 3D atomic coordinates and element identities. The method assigns hybridizations, bond orders, and formal charges for structures whether hydrogen atoms are present. The Maximum Weighted Matching algorithm for nonbipartite graphs is used to assign bond orders with weights derived from statistics of a large collection of organic molecules. Results form tests on a collection of functional groups, heterocycles, entries from the Protein Data Bank, and Cambridge Structural Database as well as a comparison to other methods, are presented and discussed.

title = {SATIS: Atom typing from chemical connectivity},
abstract = {SATIS (simple atom type information system) is a protocol for the definition and automatic assignment of atom types and the classification of atoms according to their covalent connectivity. Its distinctive feature is that no bond type information is involved. Rather, the classification of each atom is based on a connectivity code describing the atom and its covalent partners. It is particularly useful when handling coordinate-based molecular representations with no bond order information, such as the PDB format. We survey the occurrence of the various connectivity codes in the 20 common amino acid residues in a sample of 304 different moieties from PDB protein-ligand complexes and also in a pseudo-random sample of 309 organic molecules from the CSD. We illustrate how connectivity codes can be grouped together to define atom types. We expect SATIS to be applicable to the derivation of atom types for statistical potentials, to the analysis of atomic interactions in structural databases, to studies of molecular similarity, and to the screening of virtual libraries in drug design.},

abstract = {With the growth of interest in database searching and compound selection, the quantification of chemical similarity has become an area of intense practical and theoretical interest. One of the most widely used methods of measuring chemical similarity is based on mapping fragments within a molecule as bits within a binary string. We present empirical results which suggest that bit strings provide a nonintuitive encoding of molecular size, shape, and global similarity. Other results, this time statistical in nature, suggest that the observed behavior of bit string- based searches have a large nonspecific component. On this basis, we question whether bit string-based similarity methods possess all the features desirable in a quantitative chemical distance measure or metric and suggest that there are instances when they may not be the most appropriate tool for searching or segregating chemical structures.},

title = {New computer aided methods for revealing structural features of unknown compounds using low resolution mass spectra},
abstract = {Two new computer methods designed to reveal structural features of unknown compounds by means of low resolution mass spectra presented. Both methods use the results of a spectral similarity in a mass spectral database. The first one proceeds by intersecting selected structures in order to find maximal common substructures, while the second proceeds by decomposing these structures to derive fragments following a model of primary fragmentation of organic molecules. Reliability of the revealed fragments is estimated by comparing an unknown compound's spectrum with the computed spectral images of each fragment. The usefulness and Limitations of the two proposed methods are estimated using a set of test examples. In many cases the two methods are complementary, whereas overall, the second looks more promising both revealing large structural fragments and for generation of candidate structures, because the fragments revealed have only one or two free valences and rarely overlap one another.

abstract = {Solubility data for 930 diverse compounds have been analyzed using linear Partial Least Square (PLS) and nonlinear PLS methods, Continuum Regression (CR), and Neural Networks (NN). 1D and 2D descriptors from MOE package in combination with E-state or ISIS keys have been used. The best model was obtained using linear PLS for a combination between 22 MOE descriptors and 65 ISIS keys. It has a correlation coefficient (r(2)) of 0.935 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.468 log molar solubility (log S,). The model validated on a test set of 177 compounds not included in the training set has r(2) 0.911 and RMSE 0.475 log S-w. The descriptors were ranked according to their importance, and at the top of the list have been found the 22 MOE descriptors. The CR model produced results as good as PLS, and because of the way in which cross-validation has been done it is expected to be a valuable tool in prediction besides PLS model. The statistics obtained using nonlinear methods did not surpass those got with linear ones. The good statistic obtained for linear PLS and CR recommends these models to be used in prediction when it is difficult or impossible to make experimental measurements, for virtual screening, combinatorial library design, and efficient leads optimization.

For the first time a fast method for metabolic screening that can be automated is described for this organism. More than 1000 compounds could be detected per experiment, ca. 330 of those showed a peak area significantly above background. Out of these 164 compounds were identified so far, representing derivatives of 121 different metabolites, which were quantified in one sample. In spite of the different chemical nature of metabolites and high matrix content, a measurement reproducibility in the range of 6% error was achieved. The application of this method for the analysis of the adaptation of C. glutamicum to different growth conditions is demonstrated.},

title = {Citation Advantage of Open Access Articles},
abstract = {Open access (OA) to the research literature has the potential to accelerate recognition and dissemination of research findings, but its actual effects are controversial. This was a longitudinal bibliometric analysis of a cohort of OA and non-OA articles published between June 8, 2004, and December 20, 2004, in the same journal (PNAS: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Article characteristics were extracted, and citation data were compared between the two groups at three different points in time: at {\&}{\#}8220;quasi-baseline{\&}{\#}8221; (December 2004, 0{\&}{\#}8211;6 mo after publication), in April 2005 (4{\&}{\#}8211;10 mo after publication), and in October 2005 (10{\&}{\#}8211;16 mo after publication). Potentially confounding variables, including number of authors, authors{\&}{\#}39; lifetime publication count and impact, submission track, country of corresponding author, funding organization, and discipline, were adjusted for in logistic and linear multiple regression models. A total of 1,492 original research articles were analyzed: 212 (14.2{\&}{\#}37; of all articles) were OA articles paid by the author, and 1,280 (85.8{\&}{\#}37;) were non-OA articles. In April 2005 (mean 206 d after publication), 627 (49.0{\&}{\#}37;) of the non-OA articles versus 78 (36.8{\&}{\#}37;) of the OA articles were not cited (relative risk {\&}{\#}61; 1.3 {\&}{\#}91;95{\&}{\#}37; Confidence Interval: 1.1{\&}{\#}8211;1.6{\&}{\#}93;; p {\&}{\#}61; 0.001). 6 mo later (mean 288 d after publication), non-OA articles were still more likely to be uncited (non-OA: 172 {\&}{\#}91;13.6{\&}{\#}37;{\&}{\#}93;, OA: 11 {\&}{\#}91;5.2{\&}{\#}37;{\&}{\#}93;; relative risk {\&}{\#}61; 2.6 {\&}{\#}91;1.4{\&}{\#}8211;4.7{\&}{\#}93;; p {\&}{\#}60; 0.001). The average number of citations of OA articles was higher compared to non-OA articles (April 2005: 1.5 {\&}{\#}91;SD {\&}{\#}61; 2.5{\&}{\#}93; versus 1.2 {\&}{\#}91;SD {\&}{\#}61; 2.0{\&}{\#}93;; Z {\&}{\#}61; 3.123; p {\&}{\#}61; 0.002; October 2005: 6.4 {\&}{\#}91;SD {\&}{\#}61; 10.4{\&}{\#}93; versus 4.5 {\&}{\#}91;SD {\&}{\#}61; 4.9{\&}{\#}93;; Z {\&}{\#}61; 4.058; p {\&}{\#}60; 0.001). In a logistic regression model, controlling for potential confounders, OA articles compared to non-OA articles remained twice as likely to be cited (odds ratio {\&}{\#}61; 2.1 {\&}{\#}91;1.5{\&}{\#}8211;2.9{\&}{\#}93;) in the first 4{\&}{\#}8211;10 mo after publication (April 2005), with the odds ratio increasing to 2.9 (1.5{\&}{\#}8211;5.5) 10{\&}{\#}8211;16 mo after publication (October 2005). Articles published as an immediate OA article on the journal site have higher impact than self-archived or otherwise openly accessible OA articles. We found strong evidence that, even in a journal that is widely available in research libraries, OA articles are more immediately recognized and cited by peers than non-OA articles published in the same journal. OA is likely to benefit science by accelerating dissemination and uptake of research findings.},

title = {2D-3D migration of large chemical inventories with conformational multiplication. Application of the genetic algorithm},
abstract = {Mathematical chemistry has afforded a variety of research areas with important tools to understand and predict the behavior of chemicals without having to consider the complexities of three-dimensional conformations of molecules. Predictive toxicology, all area of increasing importance to toxicity assessments critical to molecular design and risk management, must be based on more explicit descriptions of structure, however. Minimum energy conformations are often used for convenience due, in part, to the difficulty of computing a representative Population of conformers in all but rigid structures. Such simplifying assumptions fail to reveal the variance of the stereoelectronic nature of molecules as well as the misclassification of chemicals which initiate receptor-based toxicity pathways. Because these errors impact both the Success ill discovering new lead and the identification of possible hazards, it is important that mathematical chemistry develop additional tools for conformational analysis. This paper presents a new system for automated 2D-3D migration of chemicals in large databases with conformer multiplication. The main advantages of this system are its straightforward performance, reasonable execution time, simplicity and applicability to building large 3D chemical inventories. The module for conformer multiplication within the 2D-3D migration system is based oil a new formulation of the genetic algorithm for computing populations of possible conformers. b The performance of the automated 2D-3D migration system in building a centralized 3D database for all chemicals in commerce worldwide is discussed. The applicability of the 3D database in assessing the impact of molecular flexibility on identifying active conformers in QSAR analysis and assessing similarity between chemicals is illustrated.

abstract = {Characteristic features of a new expert system StrucEluc are described. The system is intended for the structure elucidation of complex organic molecules using a variety of spectroscopic data including 2D NMR. We review here the results of challenging this system with over 100 structure elucidation problems where the 2D NMR peak tables presented in original journal publications provided the input data. This contribution is focused on methods to overcome difficult situations that can arise when contradictions are present in the input data and/or when the structure is underdetermined as a result of insufficient 2D NMR correlations. Methods by which to address these situations are examined. It has been shown that synergy between the spectroscopist and the expert system allows the solution of problems that seemed to be hopeless at the outset of the structure elucidation process.

abstract = {The search of molecular structures inside a large database of chemical compounds is a critical step for many computer programs used in several domains of chemistry. During the last years, the size of many chemical databases has dramatically increased, hence in the meantime, search engines needed to be more and more powerful. The speed and the efficiency of screening processes of the chemical compounds are thus essential. Looking forward for algorithms dedicated to structure and substructure search, we have developed a new graph descriptor for structures containing cycles in order to find efficient indexation and classification criteria of molecular structures. This graph descriptor can be used as a screening criteria for structure and substructure search in large databases of organic compounds. [References]},

title = {Encoding the core electrons with graph concepts},
abstract = {The core electron problem of atoms in chemical graph studies has always been considered as a minor problem. Usually, chemical graphs had to encode just a small set of second row atoms, i.e., C, N, 0, and F, thus, graph and, in some cases, pseudograph concepts were enough to "graph" encode the molecules at hand. Molecular connectivity theory, together with its side-branch the electrotopological state, introduced two "ad hoc" algorithms for the core electrons of higher-row atoms based, mainly, on quantum concepts alike. Recently, complete graphs, and, especially, odd complete graphs have been introduced to encode the core electrons of higher-row atoms. By the aid of these types of graphs a double-valued algorithm has been proposed for the valence delta, delta(v), of any type of atoms of the periodic table with a principal quantum number n greater than or equal to 2. The new algorithm is centered on an invariant suggested by the hand-shaking theorem, and the values it gives rise to parallel in some way the values derived by the aid of the two old "quantum" algorithms. A thorough comparative analysis of the newly proposed algorithms has been undertaken for atoms of the group 1A-7A of the periodic table. This comparative study includes the electronegativity, the size of the atoms, the first ionization energy, and the electron affinity. The given algorithm has also been tested with sequential complete graphs, while the even complete graphs give rise to conceptual difficulties. QSAR/QSPR studies do not show a clear-cut preference for any of the two values the algorithm gives rise to, even if recent results seem to prefer one of the two values. [References: 20]},

title = {Enhanced structure elucidation},
abstract = {Conventional approaches to the structure elucidation of organic compounds are based on the use of spectroscopic data from different sources. The spectroscopist's task to interpret the spectra and to derive structure proposals. The efficiency of this process depends mainly on his or her knowledge of structure spectrum correlations, acquired in the course of everyday work. The most time-consuming process, that assembling structures using the substructure information extracted from the spectra can be performed by computers. The ''brain'' of the computer is a structure oriented spectroscopic database and the knowledge derived from it. The structure building part is an isomer generator which accepts substructure inferences from the spectroscopist or from interpretation software. A final checking of the generated candidates is performed using spectrum prediction tools. The modules described are part of SpecInfo 3, a new software system for enhanced structure elucidation.

The convergence is guided by simulated annealing. The gatekeeper administers a list of server processes, which can be retrieved by the client. The package is completely platform-independent and its server part can be distributed over the Internet or an intranet using a heterogeneous network of almost any number and type of computers, thus allowing for parallel CASE computations on ordinary networks, present in almost any institution.

The interpretation of diterpene C- 13 NMR spectra normally requires specialists with detailed spectroscopic knowledge and substantial experience in natural products chemistry, specifically knowledge on peak patterns and chemical structures. Given a database of peak patterns for diterpenes with known structure, we apply several ILP approaches to discover correlations between peak patterns and chemical structure. The approaches used include first-order inductive learning, relational instance based learning, induction of logical decision trees, and inductive constraint logic. Performance close to that of domain experts is achieved, which suffices for practical use.},

title = {Chemical substructure identification by mass spectral library searching},
abstract = {A library-search procedure that identifies structural features of an unknown compound from its electron-ionization mass spectrum is Like other methods, this procedure first retrieves library compounds whose spectra are most similar to the spectrum of an unknown compound. then deduces structural features of the unknown compound from the chemical structures of the retrievals. Unlike other methods, the significance of each retrieved spectrum is weighted according to its similarity to the spectrum of the unknown compound. Also, a ''peaks-in-common'' screening step serves to reduce search and an optimized dot product function provides the match factor. If molecular weight of the unknown compound is provided, the of certain substructures can be improved by including ''neutral loss'' peaks. Correlations between the presence of a substructure in a test compound and its presence among library retrievals were derived from the results of searching the NIST/EPA/NIH reference library with a 7891 compound test set. These correlations allow the estimation of probabilities of substructure occurrence and absence in an unknown compound from the results of a library search. This method may be as an optimization of the ''K-nearest neighbor'' method of Isenhour co-workers, with improvements that arise from spectrum screening, peak scaling, an optimal distance measure, a relative-distance weighting scheme, and a larger reference library.

title = {Seven Golden Rules for heuristic filtering of molecular formulas obtained by accurate mass spectrometry},
abstract = {Background: Structure elucidation of unknown small molecules by mass spectrometry is a challenge despite advances in instrumentation. The first crucial step is to obtain correct elemental compositions. In order to automatically constrain the thousands of possible candidate structures, rules need to be developed to select the most likely and chemically correct molecular formulas.Results: An algorithm for filtering molecular formulas is derived from seven heuristic rules: (1) restrictions for the number of elements, (2) LEWIS and SENIOR chemical rules, (3) isotopic patterns, (4) hydrogen/carbon ratios, (5) element ratio of nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor, and sulphur versus carbon, (6) element ratio probabilities and (7) presence of trimethylsilylated compounds. Formulas are ranked according to their isotopic patterns and subsequently constrained by presence in public chemical databases. The seven rules were developed on 68,237 existing molecular formulas and were validated in four experiments. First, 432,968 formulas covering five million PubChem database entries were checked for consistency. Only 0.6% of these compounds did not pass all rules. Next, the rules were shown to effectively reducing the complement all eight billion theoretically possible C, H, N, S, O, P-formulas up to 2000 Da to only 623 million most probable elemental compositions. Thirdly 6,000 pharmaceutical, toxic and natural compounds were selected from DrugBank, TSCA and DNP databases. The correct formulas were retrieved as top hit at 80-99% probability when assuming data acquisition with complete resolution of unique compounds and 5% absolute isotope ratio deviation and 3 ppm mass accuracy. Last, some exemplary compounds were analyzed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and by gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry. In each case, the correct formula was ranked as top hit when combining the seven rules with database queries.Conclusion: The seven rules enable an automatic exclusion of molecular formulas which are either wrong or which contain unlikely high or low number of elements. The correct molecular formula is assigned with a probability of 98% if the formula exists in a compound database. For truly novel compounds that are not present in databases, the correct formula is found in the first three hits with a probability of 65-81%.

The robustness of the different approaches continues to deal with problems of completeness and uniqueness; nevertheless, the future is very bright for automation of NMR structure generation to approach the levels found in X-ray crystallography. Currently, near completely automated structure determination is possible for small proteins, and the prospect for medium-sized and large proteins is good. [References: 47]},

abstract = {Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolite profiling of biological samples is rapidly becoming one of the cornerstones of functional genomics and systems biology. Thus, the technology needs to be available to many laboratories and open exchange of information is required such as those achieved for transcript and protein data. The key-step in metabolite profiling is the unambiguous identification of metabolites in highly complex metabolite preparations with composite structure. Collections of mass spectra, which comprise frequently observed identified and non-identified metabolites, represent the most effective means to pool the identification efforts currently performed in many laboratories around the world. Here, we describe a platform for mass spectral and retention time index libraries that will enable this process (MSRI; www.csbdb.mpimpgolm.mpg.delgmd.html). This resource should ameliorate many of the problems that each laboratory will face both for the initial establishment of metabolome analysis and for its maintenance at a constant sample throughput.

title = {The identification of ligand features essential for PXR activation by pharmacophore modeling},
abstract = {Drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters are often involved in clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. These functional proteins can be induced by a wide range of xenobiotics. The induction is inediated by a group of receptors known as orphan nuclear receptors. The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a member of this receptor family and regulates the expression of multiple Cytochrome P450 enzyme families (e.g. CYP 3A and 213), phase II enzymes (e.g. UDP glucuronosyl transferases), and transporters (e.g. multidrug resistance protein 1). The software package Catalyst was employed to derive pharmacophore models for PXR activation. A structure based pharmacophore hypothesis and several ligand based ones were compared in order to identify ligand receptor interactions essential for receptor activation. The results suggest that hydrogen bonding to Gln285 is indispensable for PXR activation. Most ligands were found to form a second hydrogen bond to His407. Hydrophobic interactions are not essential for receptor activation but Contribute to ligand affinity. Highly active compounds share LIP to five hydrophobic features that allow the ligand to Occupy large areas of the predominantly hydrophobic binding pocket. [References: 24]},

title = {Whole-molecule calculation of Log P based on molar volume, hydrogen bonds, and simulated C-13 NMR spectra},
abstract = {The prediction of Log P is usually accomplished using either substructure or whole-molecule approaches. However, these methods are complicated, and previous whole-molecule approaches have not been successful for the prediction of Log P in very complex molecules. The observed chemical shifts in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are related to the electrostatics at the nucleus, which are influenced by solute-solvent interactions. The different solvation effects on a molecule by either water or methanol have a strong effect on the NMR chemical shift value. Therefore, the chemical shift values observed in an aqueous and organic solvent should correlate to Log P. This paper develops a rapid, objective model of Log P based on molar volume, hydrogen bonds, and differences in calculated C-13 NMR chemical shifts for a diverse set of compounds. A partial least squares (PLS) model of Log P built on the sum of carbon chemical shift differences in water and methanol, molar volume, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in 162 diverse compounds gave an r(2) value of 0.88. The average r(2) for 10 training models of Log P made from 90% of the data was 0.87 � 0.01. The average q(2) for 10 leave-10%-out cross-validation test sets was 0.87 � 0.05. [References: 28]},

The topic is given further consideration here with the help of integer statistics. Discussed are the ramifications of an integer variable Q, which quantifies the total number of binding complexions for an organic molecule. Offered is a statistical view of the maximum allowed number of independent regions D expressed by the molecule, dependent on Ohm(t). We illustrate the distribution properties of D along with upper limit estimates of the regioinformation mu, also dependent on Ohm(t). Integer statistics based on elementary number theory establish the key distribution properties of D and mu. In so doing, the traits distinguishing high regioinformation molecules are enumerated. The statistical approach encompasses all possible molecules and conditions, not just those reported to date in chemical databases. The aim is to view the regioinformation expressed by molecules in an alternative and general way. [References: 31]},

Conventional 1D and 2D NMR methods enabled the identification of about 35 compounds, including minor components such as some medium-chain alcohols, amino acids, and organic acids. High-resolution (HR) DOSY extended sample characterization, increasing the number of compounds identified and NMR assignments made, by providing information on the relative molecular sizes of the metabolites present. Port wines of different ages were found to differ mainly in their content of (a) organic acids and some amino acids, (b) an unidentified possible disaccharide, and (c) large aromatic species. The relative amount of these last high M,, aromatics is seen to decrease significantly in the oldest wine, as expected from the known formation and precipitation of anthocyanin-based polymers during red wine aging.},

title = {A ligand-centric analysis of the diversity and evolution of protein-ligand relationships in E-coli},
abstract = {As enzymes evolve and diverge from common ancestor sequences, they often keep their overall reaction chemistry but specialise in the binding of different cognate ligands. This study borrows methods for the computational assessment of 2D similarity of small molecules from the field of chemoinformatics, to examine the extent of structure conservation of cognate ligands binding to similar proteins. Proteins from 87 structural superfamilies from Escherichia coli form the core dataset, which is extended using homologues with functional assignments from any organism. We find that correlation of the substrate similarity with protein similarity (measured by either sequence-based or structure-based scores) can only be clearly established for very similar proteins. At low sequence identities, the superfamily to which a protein belongs can give helpful clues to its function, and more importantly, the confidence attached to such clues is superfamily-dependent. Our data indicate that only a few superfamilies show great substrate diversity, and that most exhibit conservation of at least part of the structural scaffold of the substrate. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Data quality in biological databases has become a topic of great discussion. To provide high quality data and to deal with the vast amount of biochemical data, annotators and curators need to be supported by software that carries out part of their work in an (semi-) automatic manner. The detection of errors and inconsistencies is a part that requires the knowledge of domain experts, thus in most cases it is done manually, making it very expensive and time-consuming. This paper presents two tools to partially support the curation of data on biochemical pathways. The tool enables the automatic classification of chemical compounds based on their respective SMILES strings. Such classification allows the querying and visualization of biochemical reactions at different levels of abstraction, according to the level of detail at which the reaction participants are described. Chemical compounds can be classified in a flexible manner based on different criteria. The support of the process of data curation is provided by facilitating the detection of compounds that are identified as different ut that are actually the same. This is also used to identify similar reactions and, in turn, pathways. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A new method of structure generation, involving two steps, structure reduction and structure assembly, is presented. The goal of structure reduction is to reduce the number of connections between fragments and, consequently, the number of combinations that are considered in the second step. The structure assembly is a directed and controlled combinatorial process based on a generation tree. In contrast to other known generation methods, no comparisons and symmetry tests of intermediate fragments are made during this combinatorial process. Because the generation of duplicates cannot be completely avoided, the comparisons of final structures based on a quasi-tree representation of structures are performed to reject duplicates. The new method is called GEN and implemented on IBM PC and compatible computers. The effectiveness and applicability of GEN is demonstrated on several different examples and compared to some other generation methods. [References: 33]},

Conditions for computer-aided solution of problems using expert systems (ES) are analyzed. Reasons incorrect or zero solutions and for inconsistencies leading to results are examined. The role of additional information as a condition for correct solution is discussed. On the basis of this analysis, a general strategy for structure elucidation of molecules by their spectra using ES is suggested. The principal idea is to use the iteration method gradually increasing the rigidity of constraints. Strategies named ARCHEOLOGIST SCULPTOR are discussed. Examples are given. [References: 16]},

abstract = {The determination of the validity of a QSAR model when applied to new compounds is an important concern in the field of QSAR and QSPR modeling. Various scoring techniques can be applied to specific types of models. We present a technique with which we can state whether a new compound will be well predicted by a previously built QSAR model. In this study we focus on linear regression models only, though the technique is general and could also be applied to other types of quantitative models. Our technique is based on a classification method that divides regression residuals from a previously generated model into a good class and bad class and then builds a classifier based on this division. The trained classifier is then used to determine the class of the residual for a new compound. We investigated the performance of a variety of classifiers, both linear and nonlinear. The technique was tested on two data sets from the literature and a hand built data set. The data sets selected covered both physical and biological properties and also presented the methodology with quantitative regression models of varying quality. The results indicate that this technique can determine whether a new compound will be well or poorly predicted with weighted success rates ranging from 73% to 94% for the best classifier.

abstract = {The SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase is considered as a potential drug design target for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Owing to the lack of available drugs for the treatment of SARS, the discovery of inhibitors for SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase that can potentially be optimized as drugs appears to be highly desirable. We have built a "flexible" three-dimensional model for SARS 3C-like proteinase by homology modeling and multicanonical molecular dynamics method and used the model for virtual screening of chemical databases. After Dock procedures, strategies including pharmocophore model, consensus scoring, and "drug-like" filters were applied in order to accelerate the process and improve the success rate of virtual docking screening hit lists. Forty compounds were purchased and tested by HPLC and colorimetric assay against SARS 3C-like proteinase. Three of them including calmidazolium, a well-known antagonist of calmodulin, were found to inhibit the enzyme with an apparent K-i from 61 to 178 mu M. These active compounds and their binding modes provide useful information for understanding the binding sites and for further selective drug design against SARS and other coronavirus.

title = {New software solutions for analytical spectroscopists},
abstract = {Analytical spectroscopists must be computer literate to effectively out the tasks assigned to them. This has often been resisted within organizations with insufficient funds to equip their staff properly, a lack of desire to deliver the essential training and a basic amongst staff to learn the new techniques required for computer analysis. In the past these problems were compounded by seriously flawed which was being sold for spectroscopic;applications. Owing to the market for such complex products the analytical spectroscopist often faced with buying incomplete and unstable tools if the price was to remain reasonable. Long product lead times meant spectrometer manufacturers often ended up offering systems running under outdated sometimes obscure operating systems. Not only did this mean special training for each instrument where the knowledge gained on one system could not be transferred to the neighbouring system but these spectrometers were often only capable of running in a stand-alone cut-off from the rest of the laboratory environment. Fortunately a number of developments in recent years have changed this depressing picture. A true multi-tasking operating system with a simple graphical user interface, Microsoft Windows NT4, has now been widely introduced into spectroscopic computing environment which has provided a desktop operating system which has proved to be more stable and robust as well requiring better programming techniques of software vendors. The opening up of the Internet has provided an easy way to access new tools for data handling and has forced a substantial rethink about results delivery (for example Chemical MIME, types, IUPAC data exchange standards). Improved computing power and cheaper hardware now allows large spectroscopic data sets to be handled without too many problems. This includes the ability to carry out chemometric operations in minutes rather than hours. Fast networks now enable data analysis of even multi-dimensional spectroscopic data sets remote from the measuring instrument. A strong tendency to opt for a more unified graphical user interface which is substantially more user friendly allows even inexperienced users to rapidly get acquainted with even the complex mathematical analyses. Some examples of new spectroscopic software products will be given to demonstrate the aforesaid paints and highlight the ease of integration into a modern analytical spectroscopy workplace.

title = {QSPR modeling: Graph connectivity indices versus line graph indices},
abstract = {Five QSPR models of alkanes were reinvestigated. Properties considered were molecular surface-dependent properties (boiling points and gas chromatographic retention indices) and molecular volume-dependent properties (molar volumes and molar refractions). The vertex- and edge-connectivity indices were used as structural parameters. In each studied case we computed connectivity indices of alkane trees and line graphs and searched for the optimum exponent. Models based on indices with an optimum exponent and on the standard value of the exponent were compared. Thus, for each property we generated six QSPR models (four for alkane trees and two for the corresponding line In all studied cases QSPR models based on connectivity indices with optimum exponents have better statistical characteristics than the based on connectivity indices with the standard value of the exponent. The comparison between models based on vertex- and edge-connectivity indices gave in two cases (molar volumes and molar refractions) better models based on edge-connectivity indices and in three cases (boiling points for octanes and nonanes and gas chromatographic retention better models based on vertex-connectivity indices. Thus, it appears the edge-connectivity index is more appropriate to be used in the structure-molecular volume properties modeling and the vertex-connectivity index in the structure-molecular surface modeling. The use of line graphs did not improve the predictive power the connectivity indices. Only in one case (boiling points of nonanes) better model was obtained with the use of line graphs.

Using a field strength of 7.0 T, protons require a coupling constant of 4 Hz with a chemical shift separation of 0.3 ppm, whereas carbon needs a coupling constant of 25 Hz for a chemical shift difference of 10 ppm, based on the minimal coupling approximation. Using these guidelines, it was determined that 2,3-dibromothiophene is limited to only two qubits; the three qubit system bromotrifluoroethene could be expanded to five qubits and the three qubit system 2,3-dibromopropanoic acid could also be used as a six qubit system. An examination of substituent effects showed that judiciously choosing specific groups could increase the number of available qubits by removing rotational degeneracies in addition to introducing specific conformational preferences that could increase (or decrease) the magnitude of the couplings. The introduction of one site of unsaturation can lead to a marked improvement in spectroscopic properties, even increasing the number of active nuclei. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

title = {Structure elucidation from 2D NMR spectra using the StrucEluc expert system: Detection and removal of contradictions in the data},
abstract = {The elucidation of chemical structures from 2D NMR data commonly utilizes a combination of COSY, HMQC/HSQC, and HMBC data. Generally COSY connectivities are assumed to mostly describe the separation of protons that are separated by 1 skeletal bond ((3)J(HH)), while HMBC connectivities represent protons separated from carbon atoms by 1 to 2 skeletal bonds ((2)J(CH) and (3)J(CH)). Obviously COSY and HMBC connectivities of lengths greater than those described have been detected. Though experimental techniques have recently been described to aid in the identification of the nature of the couplings the detection of whether a coupling is 2-bond or greater still remains a challenge in most laboratories. In the StrucEluc software system the common lengths of the connectivities, I-bond for COSY and 1- or 2-bond for HMBC, derived from 2D NMR data are set as the default. Therefore, in the presence of any extended connectivities contradictions can appear in the 2D NMR data. In this article, algorithmic methods for the detection and removal of contradictions in 2D NMR data that have been developed in support of StrucEluc are described. The methods are based on the analysis of molecular connectivity diagrams, MCDs. These methods have been implemented in the StrucEluc system and tested by solving 50 structural problems with 2D NMR spectral data containing contradictions. The presence of contradictions was detected by the algorithm in 90% of the cases, and the contradictions were automatically removed in similar to50% of the problems. A method of "fuzzy" structure generation in the presence of contradictions has been suggested and successfully tested in this work. This work will demonstrate examples of the application of developed methods to a number of structural problems. [References: 24]},

abstract = {Molecular descriptors were identified by Shannon entropy analysis that correctly distinguished in binary QSAR calculations, between naturally occurring molecules and synthetic compounds. The Shannon entropy was first used in digital communication theory and has only very been applied to descriptor analysis. Binary QSAR methodology was originally developed to correlate structural features and properties compounds with a binary formulation of biological activity (i.e., or inactive) and has here been adapted to correlate molecular features with chemical source (i.e., natural or synthetic). We have identified a number of molecular descriptors with significantly different shannon entropy and/or "entropic separation" in natural and synthetic compound;databases, Different combinations of such and variably distributed structural keys were applied to learning sets consisting of natural and synthetic molecules;and used to derive predictive binary QSAR models. These models were then applied to. the source of compounds in different test sets consisting of randomly collected natural and synthetic molecules, gr alternatively, sets of natural and synthetic molecules with specific biological activities. average, greater than 80% prediction accuracy was achieved with our models. For the test case consisting of molecules with specific activities, greater than 90% accuracy was achieved. From our analysis, some chemical features were identified that systematically differ in many naturally occurring versus synthetic molecules. [References: 23]},

title = {Counterexamples in chemical ring perception},
abstract = {Ring information is a large part of the structural topology used to identify and characterize molecular structures. It is hence of crucial importance to obtain this information for a variety of tasks in computational chemistry. Many different approaches for "ring perception", i.e., the extraction of cycles from a molecular Graph, have been described. The chemistry literature on this topic, however, reports a surprisingly large number of incorrect statements about the properties of chemically relevant ring sets and, in particular, about the mutual relationships of different sets of cycles in a graph. In part these problems seem to have arisen from a sometimes rather idiosyncratic terminology for notions that are fairly standard in graph theory. In this contribution we translate the definitions of concepts such as the Smallest Set of Smallest Rings, Essential Set of Essential Rings, Extended Set of Smallest Rings, Set of Smallest Cycles at Edges, Set of Elementary Ring, K-rings, and beta-rings into a more widely used mathematical language. We then outline the basic properties of different cycle sets and provide numerous counterexamples to incorrect claims in the published literature. These counterexamples may have a serious practical impact because at least some of them are molecular graphs of well-known molecules. As a consequence, we propose a catalog of desirable properties for chemically useful sets of rings.},

abstract = {In order to discover new bioactive compounds from plant sources which could become new leads or new drugs, extracts should be submitted at the same time to chemical screening and to various biological or pharmacological targets. Metabolite profiling using hyphenated techniques such as LC/UV, LC/MS and more recently LC/NMR, quickly provides plenty of structural information, leading to a partial or a complete on-line de novo structure determination of the natural products of interest. As a complement to this approach, bioassays performed after LC/microfractionation of the extracts allow efficient localisation of the bioactive LC-peaks in the chromatograms. The combination of metabolite profiling and LC/bioassays provides the possibility of distinguishing between already known bioactive compounds (dereplication) and new molecules directly in crude plant extracts. Thus, the tedious isolation of compounds of low interest can be avoided and targeted isolation of new bioactive products or constituents presenting novel or unusual spectroscopic features can be undertaken. Several examples of rapid localisation of bioactive compounds, based on post-chromatographic bioautographic testing of LC/NMR microfractions and subsequent on-line identification will be illustrated. Application of hyphenated techniques for the efficient characterisation of labile constituents or constituents difficult to separate at the preparative scale will also be mentioned. The possibilities and limitations of LC/UV/NMR/MS and LC/bioassay as well as future development expected in this field will be discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Since the relationship between topological and Euclidean distance contains 3D structural information, in the present paper a modified version of an autocorrelation approach is proposed to include this type of information. Steric, electronic, and indicator-variable-type descriptors are calculated and used in QSAR studies with three different data sets. The results demonstrate that the descriptors can be efficiently used in cluster- and QSAR analysis. The models obtained are highly predictive and comparable to those obtained by other commonly used 3D-QSAR methods. [References: 33]},

title = {Molecular property eXplorer: A novel approach to visualizing SAR using tree-maps and heatmaps},
abstract = {The tremendous increase in chemical structure and biological activity data brought about through combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening technologies has created the need for sophisticated graphical tools for visualizing and exploring structure -activity data. Visualization plays an important role in exploring and understanding relationships within such multidimensional data sets. Many chemoinformatics software applications apply standard clustering techniques to organize structure-activity data, but they differ significantly in their approaches to visualizing clustered data. Molecular Property eXplorer (MPX) is unique in its presentation Of Clustered data in the form of heatmaps and tree-maps. MPX employs agglomerative hierarchical clustering to organize data on the basis of the similarity between 2D chemical structures or similarity across a predefined profile of biological assay values. Visualization of hierarchical clusters as tree-maps and heatmaps provides simultaneous representation of cluster members along with their associated assay values. Tree-maps convey both the spatial relationship among Cluster members and the value of a single property (activity) associated with each member. Heatmaps provide visualization of the Cluster members across an activity profile. Unlike a tree-map, however, a heatmap does not convey the spatial relationship between cluster members. MPX seamlessly integrates tree-maps and heatmaps to represent multidimensional Structure-activity data in a visually intuitive manner. In addition, MPX provides tools for clustering data on the basis of chemical structure or activity profile, displaying 2D chemical structures, and querying the data based over a specified activity range, or set of chemical structure criteria (e.g., Tanimoto similarity, substructure match, and "R-group" analysis).

We demonstrate that a simultaneous alignment on two target structures-in conjunction with logic operations on interactions and docking constraints derived from protein structure-is an effective means of (i) improving the enrichment of chemical substructures that are compatible with the a priori known ligands, (ii) ensuring the steric fit into the target protein, and (iii) handling target flexibility. The combination of ligand- and receptor-based methods steers the virtual screening by ranking molecules according to the similarity of their interaction pattern with known ligands, thereby-to some extent-outweighing the deficiencies of simple scoring functions often used in initial virtual screening.

title = {Pattern-recognition and alternative physical-chemistry methodologies},
abstract = {Alternative formalisms for two different domains in physical chemistry are considered here: thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. In thermodynamics the performance of a diagrammatic method based on geometric and algebraic considerations is illustrated here. This method based on the particular symmetry of a thermodynamic diagram allows one to obtain the most important thermodynamic expressions of a simple system and to solve thermodynamic problems strictly related to these expressions. The different thermodynamic expressions can be developed with the application of various geometric patterns to the proposed diagram. Furthermore, the particular structure of this diagram allows one to develop a matrix formulation of the pattern formalism. The matrix formalism requires one to recast the thermodynamic parameters of the diagram into a vectorial form. The number of thermodynamic relations that can? thus, be ''discovered'' is enormous. In chemical kinetics, two new approaches for writing kinetic equations in matrix form or directly in the integrated form are introduced here. The first method is based on the derivation of the rate K matrix of a kinetic systems of any order in a direct and straightforward way. This method, which allows one to solve first-order and some second-order kinetics with the normal matrix algebra methods, is mainly based on rate matrices which show interesting ''patterns'' due to their internal structure, which can further be used to check their validity and help to construct more complicated rate matrices. In fact, it is possible to derive a set of rules, which offers the possibility to construct rate matrices in a total mechanical way. The convolution approach to chemical kinetics applies to species that are consumed solely through first-order steps, regardless of the complexity of its formation pathways. This last method offers the possibility to formulate the rate equation directly in the integrated form, a form which shows an interesting structure, especially in the case of consecutive reaction schemes. A careful lecture of the different topics of this paper will not overlook the fact that the real subject of the proposed formalisms is the detection and recognition of patterns and to show that, sometimes, behind impressive relations or matrices a very ''unimpressive'' pattern is hiding.},

abstract = {A distance constraint model (DCM) is presented that identifies flexible regions within protein structure consistent with specified thermodynamic condition. The DCM is based on a rigorous free energy decomposition scheme representing structure as fluctuating constraint topologies. Entropy non-additivity is problematic for naive decompositions, limiting the success of heat capacity predictions. The DCM resolves non-additivity by summing over independent entropic components determined by an efficient network-rigidity algorithm. A minimal 3-parameter DCM is demonstrated to accurately reproduce experimental heat capacity curves. Free energy landscapes and quantitative stability-flexibility relationships are obtained in terms of global flexibility. Several connections to experiment are made.

title = {ADME evaluation in drug discovery. 5. Correlation of Caco-2 permeation with simple molecular properties},
abstract = {The correlations between Caco-2 permeability (logP(app)) and molecular properties have been investigated. A training set of 77 structurally diverse organic molecules was used to construct significant QSAR models for Caco-2 cell permeation. Cellular permeation was found to depend primarily upon experimental distribution coefficient (logD) at pH = 7.4, high charged polar surface area (HCPSA), and radius of gyration (rgyr). Among these three descriptors, logD may have the largest impact on diffusion through Caco-2 cell because logD shows obvious linear correlation with logP(app) (r=0.703) when logD is smaller than 2.0. High polar surface area will be unfavorable to achieve good Caco-2 permeability because higher polar surface area will introduce stronger H-bonding interactions between Caco-2 cells and drugs. The comparison among HCPSA, PSA (polar surface area), and TPSA (topological polar surface area) implies that high-charged atoms may be more important to the interactions between Caco-2 cell and drugs. Besides logD and HCPSA, rgyr is also closely connected with Caco-2 permeabilities. The molecules with larger rgyr are more difficult to cross Caco-2 monolayers than those with smaller rgyr. The descriptors included in the prediction models permit the interpretation in structural terms of the passive permeability process, evidencing the main role of lipholiphicity, H-bonding, and bulk properties. Besides these three molecular descriptors, the influence of other molecular descriptors was also investigated. From the calculated results, it can be found that introducing descriptors concerned with molecular flexibility can improve the linear correlation. The resulting model with four descriptors bears good statistical significance, n = 77, r = 0.82, q = 0.79, s = 0.45, F = 35.7. The actual predictive abilities of the QSAR model were validated through an external validation test set of 23 diverse compounds. The predictions for the tested compounds are as the same accuracy as the compounds of the training set and significantly better than those predicted by using the model reported. The good predictive ability suggests that the proposed model may be a good tool for fast screening of logP(app) for compound libraries or large sets of new chemical entities via combinatorial chemistry synthesis.

title = {Spectrometrically monitored selection experiments - quantitative laser desorption mass spectrometry of small chemical libraries},
abstract = {Background: Selection experiments involving chemical libraries are routinely used in the pharmaceutical industry for finding and optimizing lead compounds, In principle, almost any process involving a binding event or a reaction could be probed systematically with chemical libraries prepared by combinatorial synthesis, Traditionally, however, the vast majority of library members cannot be monitored during the selection, making a systematic correlation of structure and activity difficult, To interpret selection experiments on the level of all library components, monitoring technologies are required that give a unique and quantitative spectroscopic signal for every compound in a mixture. Results: Quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry of libraries of porphyrins and peptide-DNA hybrids consisting of 2-35 compounds is described. Porphyrin libraries were subjected to in vitro selections for liposome incorporation and binding to a protein pocket, it was shown that meso-hydroxyphenyl substituted porphyrins, known high activity photosensitizers of tumors, are preferentially incorporated in liposome membranes. A mixture of peptide-DNA hybrids was assayed for the nuclease stability of its components. Conclusions: Small libraries of non-isobaric compounds can be exhaustively or near-exhaustively monitored by mass spectrometry. Monitored selection experiments can yield detailed structure-activity maps in a single experiment, speeding up drug discovery and the probing of biochemically relevant recognition events. It is proposed that monitored assays for target binding, membrane partitioning, and biostability could be run in parallel, to select drug candidates combining several favorable properties in 'multidimensional' selection experiments.

abstract = {With the amount of genetic information available, a lot of attention has focused on systems biology, in particular biomolecular interactions. Considering the huge number of such interactions, and their often weak and transient nature, conventional experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy are not sufficient to gain structural insight into these. A wealth of biochemical and/or biophysical data can, however, readily be obtained for biomolecular complexes. Combining these data with docking (the process of modeling the 3D structure of a complex from its known constituents) should provide valuable structural information and complement the classical structural methods. In this review we discuss and illustrate the various sources of data that can be used to map interactions and their combination with docking methods to generate structural models of the complexes. Finally a perspective on the future of this kind of approach is given. [References: 190]},

abstract = {The green eukaryote alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular model to study control of metabolism in a photosynthetic organism. We here present method improvements for metabolite profiling based on GC-TOF mass spectrometry focusing on three parameters: quenching and cell disruption, extract solvent composition and metabolite annotation. These improvements facilitate using smaller cell numbers and hence, smaller culture volumes which enable faster and more precise sampling techniques that eventually lead to a higher number of samples that can be processed, e. g. for time course experiments. Quenching of metabolism was achieved by mixing 1 ml of culture to 1 ml of -70 degrees C cold 70% methanol. After centrifugation, cells were lyophilized and disrupted by milling using 2-6E6 lyophilized cells, around 500-fold less than previously reported. Glass beads were compared to metal balls for milling, and five different extraction solvents were tested. Additionally, all peaks were annotated in an automated way using the GC-TOF database BinBase instead of manual investigation of a single reference chromatogram. Median precision of analysis was used to decide for the eventual procedure which was applied to a proof-of-principle study of time dependent changes of metabolism under standard conditions.},

The method presented in this paper enables the recognition of structural fragments present in the molecule of an analyzed substance, Our new approach consists in generating spectra-structure correlations from a computer library of infrared spectra, e.g. an automated knowledge acquisition from an infrared spectral database, This imitates the human process of interpreting an infrared spectrum of an unknown compound. Acquisition of spectral information (a list of structural fragments and their characteristic spectral parameters) is done in order to enable identification of an unknown compound's fragments from its infrared spectrum. The spectra-structure correlations are automatically transformed into rules for substructure identification. A set of rules forms a knowledgebase becoming then a part of the system for structure elucidation. The results of testing this system for a selected set of substructures is presented in this paper.

The absolute values of the pK(a) (DFT) descriptor showed significant deviations from the experimental values of dissociation constants, but the relative trends were well-described (R-2 = 0.929, n = 40). The descriptors were used for the design of predictive models for two aquatic species Pimephales promelas and Tetrahymena pyriformis. In both cases the best performing 2-descriptor models were based on the descriptors Delta H-gas(298) and ClogP and showed good predictivity with R-2 = 0.853, R(2)cv = 0.834 for Pimephales and R-2 = 0.864, R(2)cv = 0.833 for Tetrahymena.

The correlations between J(FF) and the delocalization index calculated within the framework of the theory of atoms in molecules (AIM) and with the fluorine-fluorine internuclear separation are investigated. Both the internuclear separation and the delocalization index are found to be highly correlated with J(FF). A regression model in which the experimental J(FF) coupling constant is fitted exponentially to the internuclear separation and linearly to the delocalization index yields a squared correlation coefficient as high as 0.96 for a data set consisting of 33 coupling constants spread over a range of 85 Hz.

Once the matrix is given, its leading eigenvalue is usually calculated and used as an invariant to characterize the DNA sequence. Let M be such a matrix, and, its leading eigenvalue. Then (1/n) parallel to M parallel to(m vertical bar) and root(n-1)/n parallel to M parallel to(F) are the lower and upper bounds of lambda(1), respectively. Since their arithmetic average is an approximate value of lambda(1) and simpler for calculation, we can use it as an alternative invariant to characterize the DNA sequence. The utility of the new parameter is illustrated on the DNA sequences of five species: human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, and gallus. [References: 15]},

abstract = {We have analyzed the pairs of protein structures obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance (X-ray and NMR structures) that display no major differences when superimposed on one another (61 pairs). Analyzing atom-to-atom contacts (contact distances 2-8 Angstrom), it has been found that the NMR structures (compared to the X-ray structures) have more contacts at distances below 3.5 Angstrom and above 5.5 Angstrom. In the case of residue-to-residue contacts, the NMR structures have more contacts at distances below 3 Angstrom and between 4.5 and 6.5 Angstrom At other distances analyzed, the X-ray structures have more contacts. The difference in the numbers of atom-to-atom and residue-to-residue contacts is greater for buried residues inaccessible to water than for surface residues. Another important difference is related to the number of hydrogen bonds in the main chain: this number is greater in the X-ray structures. The coefficient of correlation between the numbers of hydrogen bonds identified in the structures obtained by both methods is only 32%. If a complete set of NMR models of protein structure is considered, the total number of hydrogen bonds proves to be 1.2 times Greater than in the X-ray structures, whereas the correlation coefficient increases to only 65%. We have also demonstrated that a-helices in the NMR structures are more distorted (compared to the ideal alpha-helix) than those in the X-ray structures. [References: 20]},

title = {A generalized approach to automated NMR peak list editing: application to reduced dimensionality triple resonance spectra},
abstract = {We present an algorithm and program called Pattern Picker that performs editing of raw peak lists derived from multidimensional NMR experiments with characteristic peak patterns. Pattern Picker detects groups of correlated peaks within peak lists from reduced dimensionality triple resonance (RD-TR) NMR spectra, with high fidelity and high yield. With typical quality RD-TR NMR data sets, Pattern Picker performs almost as well as human analysis, and is very robust in discriminating real peak sets from noise and other artifacts in unedited peak lists. The program uses a depth-first search algorithm with short-circuiting to efficiently explore a search tree representing every possible combination of peaks forming a group. The Pattern Picker program is particularly valuable for creating an automated peak picking/editing process. The Pattern Picker algorithm can be applied to a broad range of experiments with distinct peak patterns including RD, G-matrix Fourier transformation (GFT) NMR spectra, and experiments to measure scalar and residual dipolar coupling, thus promoting the use of experiments that are typically harder for a human to analyze. Since the complexity of peak patterns becomes a benefit rather than a drawback, Pattern Picker opens new opportunities in NMR experiment design. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

title = {A new algorithm for exhaustive ring perception in a molecular graph},
abstract = {A new fast and easy to implement algorithm for exhaustive ring perception is presented. This algorithm is based upon a progressive reduction (collapsing) of the path graph associated with the molecular graph studied. The path graph is an image of the molecular graph in which each vertex corresponds to a vertex of the molecular graph and each edge a-b describes an existing path between a and b in the molecular graph. During the reduction, nodes of the path graph are removed, and the information related to cycle occurrence is concentrated in the label of new edges between the remaining vertices. Each loop formed in the path graph during this collapsing process corresponds to a cycle in the molecular graph. Once the path graph has totally collapsed, all the rings in the molecular graph have been perceived. [References: 13]},

title = {Current density, chemical shifts and aromaticity},
abstract = {The intimate link between chemical shifts and magnetic criteria for aromaticity prompts a search for detailed understanding of patterns of current density induced in pi systems by external magnetic fields. Conceptual and practical advantages of calculation of current densities with a specific method of distribution of origin of vector potential, the ipsocentric choice, where the induced current density at each point is calculated with that point as origin, are outlined. This choice leads uniquely to canonical molecular orbital contributions that are free of unphysical. occupied-occupied mixing. Characteristic magnetic response of delocalized pi systems is then effectively restricted to the activity of a small number of frontier electrons, governed by simple symmetry and node-counting rules, and readily visualized in current density maps. Localized orbitals for or systems can also be used, again eliminating occupied-occupied mixing. For integrated properties (magnetizability and nuclear shieldings), the ipsocentric method gives, in a well-defined sense, the orbital contributions that are best for purposes of interpretation. The general theory is illustrated by maps for a set of annelated pentalenes; the known benzopentalene (1) and 1,2:4,5-dibenzopentalene (2), the still unknown isomer of 2, 1,2:5,6-dibenzopentalene (3), and cyclopent[b,c]acenaphthylene (4), an unknown isomer of pyracylene, all of which consist of fusions of formally aromatic and anti-aromatic pi-conjugated systems.

A method for quality estimation of solutions to spectrum-structure problems is suggested, The capacity of C-13 NMR chemical shift prediction by the additivity rules for selection the true structure was verified, Strategies of the solution to a problem are suggested. The main feature of the approach is in a series of reiterations accompanied by gradual growth severity of the constraints which are imposed on the answer structural file, It is concluded that X-PERT can be successfully used for the structure elucidation of medium-sized molecules as well as for teaching spectral methods to students.

The EA implementation proves to be a promising alternative to deterministic approaches to the problem of computer-assisted structure elucidation (CASE). While not relying on any external database, the EA-guided CASE program SENECA is able to find correct solutions within calculation times comparable to that of other CASE expert systems. The implementation presented here significantly expands the size limit of constitutional optimization problems treatable with evolutionary algorithms by introducing novel efficient graph-based genetic operators. The new EA-based search strategy is discussed including the underlying data structures, component design, parameter optimization, and evolution process control. Typical structure elucidation examples are given to demonstrate the algorithm's performance.},

title = {DOSY of sample-limited mixtures: comparison of cold, nano and conventional probes},
abstract = {The DOSY analysis of dilute mixtures can be a challenge because a high signal-to-noise ratio is required for the best DOSY results. The sensitivity increase gained from new probe technologies (e.g. cold and nano probes) could enable one to acquire good DOSY spectra on sample amounts too low for conventional probes. In this article, we investigated the performance of cold and nano probes for qualitative DOSY analysis of concentrated and sample-limited mixtures, and compared the results with those of the conventional probe. We first measured the fluid flow for each probe. All three probes exhibited only relatively small levels of flow; consequently, a double-stimulated echo pulse sequence was not employed in the subsequent DOSY experiments. This decision was based on three facts: (1) flow-induced phase distortions were not observed, (2) our intentions are only to perform qualitative mixture analysis, and (3) discarding 50% of the already limited signal cannot be afforded. Although the cold and nano probes produced DOSY results for the concentrated mixture that were inferior to the conventional probe, the increase in the signal-to-noise ratio observed with these probes proved to be advantageous for the dilute three-component mixture. Furthermore, the cold probe showed slightly superior performance over the nano probe; thus, we conclude that among the probes examined the cold probe is best suited for qualitative DOSY analysis of sample-limited mixtures.

title = {LINGO, an efficient holographic text based method to calculate biophysical properties and intermolecular similarities},
abstract = {SMILES strings are the most compact text based molecular representations. Implicitly they contain the information needed to compute all kinds of molecular structures and, thus, molecular properties derived from these structures. We show that this implicit information can be accessed directly at SMILES string level without the need to apply explicit time-consuming conversion of the SMILES strings into molecular graphs or 3D structures with subsequent 2D or 3D QSPR calculations. Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R-2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q(2)=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units. The intrinsic aqueous solubility (LlogS) QSPR model achieved correlation coefficient values of R-2=0.91, Q(2)=0.82, and RRMS=0.60 and QRMS=0.89 log units. Integral Tanimoto coefficients computed from LINGO profiles provided sharp discrimination between random and bioisoster pairs extracted from Accelrys Bioster Database. Average similarities (LINGOsim) were 0.07 for the random pairs and 0.36 for the bioisosteric pairs. [References: 25]},

The approach in spectrum interpretation is based on the determination of functional groups, which may be present or absent in compounds whose structure is unknown. The process of searching for spectrum-substructure correlation is realized by application of a statistical algorithm. In this method, correlations are generalized and condensed into a set of interpretation rules which are applied to the interpretation of an unknown compound's spectrum in order to predict whether the respective substructures are present or absent in the unknown molecule.

title = {Theoretical derivation of heuristic molecular lipophilicity potential: A quantum chemical description for molecular solvation},
abstract = {We present the theoretical derivation of a heuristic molecular lipophilicity potential (HMLP), which gives a structure-based and quantum chemical description of an important aspect of molecular solvation. The quantum mechanical electrostatic potential (ESP) V(r) on a formal molecular surface is calculated, and then the molecular lipophilicity potential L(r) is constructed by comparing the local electron density with the ESP on the surrounding atoms using a screening function. The screening function is derived from statistical mechanical theory treating the polar solvent molecules as dipoles. HMLP is able to describe the main interactions of solute molecules with polar and nonpolar solvent molecules. HMLP is a unified lipophilicity and hydrophilicity potential: its positive values represent lipophilicity, and its negative values represent hydrophilicity. In this paper, several examples show that HMLP gives more reliable descriptions for the molecular solvation than some other methods, such as atomic partial charges and the empirical lipophilicity potential.

Our focus is to support the activities of the other MSI working groups by developing a common semantic framework to enable metabolomics-user communities to consistently annotate the experimental process and to enable meaningful exchange of datasets. Our work is accessible via a public webpage and a draft ontology has been posted under the Open Biological Ontology umbrella. At the very outset, we have agreed to minimize duplications across omics domains through extensive liaisons with other communities under the OBO Foundry. This is work in progress and we welcome new participants willing to volunteer their time and expertise to this open effort.},

title = {Combinatorial ligand design targeted at protein families},
abstract = {We describe a method to create ligands specific for a given protein family. The method is applied to generate ligand candidates for the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family. The CDK family of proteins is involved in regulating the cell cycle by alternately activating and deactivating the cell's progression through the cycle. CDKs are activated by association with cyclin and are inhibited by complexation with small molecules. X-ray crystal stuctures are available for three of the thirteen known CDK family members: CDK2, CDK5 and CDK6. In this work, we use novel computational approaches to design ligand candidates that are potentially inhibitory across the three CDK family members as well as more specific molecules which can potentially inhibit one or any combination of two of the three CDK family members. We define a new scoring term, SpecScore, to quantify the potential inhibitory power of the generated structures. According to a search of the World Drug Alerts, the highest scoring SpecScore molecule that is specific for the three CDK family members shows very similar chemical characteristics and functional groups to numerous molecules known to deactivate several members of the CDK family.

abstract = {A method termed Differential Shannon Entropy (DSE) is introduced to compare differences in information content and variance of molecular descriptors between compound databases. The analysis is based on histograms recording the individual and grouped distributions of molecular descriptors and calculation of Shannon entropy (SE), a formalism originally applied to digital communication. We have recently shown that SE values reflect the nonparametric variability of descriptor settings. Now the analysis has been advanced to assess differences in information content of 143 molecular descriptors in databases containing synthetic compounds, natural products, or drug-like molecules. The DSE metric captures the degree to which descriptor distributions complement or duplicate information contained in molecular databases. In our analysis, we observe significant differences for a number of descriptors and rank them according to their associated DSE values. Using DSE calculations, relative information content of different types of descriptors can be quantified, even if differences are subtle. [References: 26]},

abstract = {With the widespread use and availability of computers for the and storage of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, particularly proton and carbon spectra, it is clear that assembly and distribution of computer-readable nmr databases is highly desirable. To maximize the utility of such efforts, it is desirable to define a standardized for information exchange and guidelines for information to be included such databases. An equally important concern is the need for nmr databases (indeed, all spectral databases) to include information will allow users to determine the quality of the spectra In 1984, at a workshop on the subject of computerized data bases held in the United States at the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute Standards and Technology), it was concluded that a consensus body, as the IUPAC, should organize and establish recommendations for such databases. As one result of that recommendation, a ''Working Party on NMR Computerized Databases'' was established, with the charge of producing recommendations of guidelines for such databases. The present document the result of the working party's efforts, is the consensus of its members, and constitutes the recommendation of the working party. [References: 9]},

abstract = {An automated scheme is described which locates the centers of cross peaks in two-dimensional correlation spectra, even under conditions of severe overlap. Double-quantum-filtered correlation (DQ-COSY) spectra have been investigated, but the method is also applicable to TOCSY and NOESY spectra. The search criterion is the intrinsic symmetry (or antisymmetry) of cross-peak. multiplets. An initial global search provides the preliminary information to build up a two-dimensional ''chemical shift grid.'' All genuine cross peaks must be centered at intersections of this grid, a fact that reduces the extent of the subsequent search program enormously. The program recognizes cross peaks by examining the symmetry of signals in a test zone centered at a grid intersection. This ''symmetry filter'' employs a ''lowest value algorithm'' to discriminate against overlapping responses from adjacent multiplets. A progressive multiplet subtraction scheme provides further suppression of overlap effects. The processed two-dimensional correlation spectrum represents cross peaks as points at the chemical shift coordinates, with some indication of their relative intensities. Alternatively, the information is presented in the form of a correlation table. The authenticity of a given cross peak is judged by a set of ''confidence criteria'' expressed as numerical parameters. Experimental results are presented for the 400- MHz double-quantum-filtered COSY spectrum of 4- androsten-3,17- dione, a case where there is severe overlap. (C) 1998 Academic Press.},

Results were obtained with a mean deviation as low as 1.8 ppm; this accuracy is equivalent to a determination on the basis of a large database but, in a time as short as known from increment calculations, was demonstrated exemplary using the natural agent epothilone A.

title = {Diversity and coverage of structural sublibraries selected using the SAGE and SCA algorithms},
abstract = {It is often impractical to synthesize and test all compounds in a large exhaustive chemical library. Herein, we discuss rational approaches to selecting representative subsets of virtual libraries that help direct experimental synthetic efforts for diverse library design. We compare the performance of two stochastic sampling algorithms, Simulating Annealing Guided Evaluation (SAGE; Zheng, W.; Cho, S. J.; Waller, C. L.; Tropsha. A. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1999, 39, 738-746.) and Stochastic Cluster Analysis (SCA; Reynolds. C. H.; Druker, R.; Pfahler, L. B. Lead Discovery Using Stochastic Cluster Analysis (SCA): A New Method for Clustering Structurally Similar Compounds J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1998, 38, 305-312.) for their ability to select both diverse and representative subsets of the entire chemical library space. The SAGE and SCA algorithms were compared using u- and s-optimal metrics as an independent assessment of diversity and coverage. This comparison showed that both algorithms were capable of generating sublibraries in descriptor space that are diverse and give reasonable coverage (i.e. are representative) of the original full library. Tests were carried out using simulated two-dimensional data sets and a 27000 compound proprietary structural library as represented by computed Molconn-Z descriptors. One of the key observations from this work is that the algorithmically simple SCA method is capable of selecting subsets that are comparable to the more computationally intensive SAGE method.

abstract = {Pruning methods for feed-forward artificial neural networks trained by the cascade-correlation learning algorithm are proposed. The cascade-correlation algorithm starts with a small network and dynamically adds new nodes until the analyzed problem has been solved. This feature of the algorithm removes the requirement to predefine the architecture of the neural network prior to network training. The developed pruning methods are used to estimate the importance of large sets of initial variables for quantitative structure-activity relationship studies and simulated data sets. The calculated results are compared with the performance of fixed-size back-propagation neural networks and multiple regression analysis and are carefully validated using different training/test set protocols, such as leave-one-out and full cross-validation procedures. The results suggest that the pruning methods can be successfully used to optimize the set of variables for the cascade- correlation learning algorithm neural networks. The use of variables selected by the elaborated methods provides an improvement of neural network prediction ability compared to that calculated using the unpruned sets of variables.},

The user can perform shortest path analysis for one or more organisms or can build virtual organisms (networks) using enzymes. Using PHT, the user can also calculate the average shortest path (Jungnickel, 2002 Graphs, Network and Algorithm. Springer-Verlag, Berlin), average alternate path and the top 10 hubs in the metabolic network. The comparative study of metabolic connectivity and observing the cross talk between metabolic pathways among various sequenced genomes is possible. Results: A new algorithm for finding the biochemically valid connectivity between metabolites in a metabolic network was developed and implemented. A predefined manual assignment of side metabolites (like ATP, ADP, water, CO2 etc.) and main metabolites is not necessary as the new concept uses chemical structure information (global and local similarity) between metabolites for identification of the shortest path.},

Results show that lower order connectivity and information theoretic TIs suffer from a high degree of redundancy, whereas higher order indices can characterize the graphs reasonably well. On the other hand, PCs derived from the TIs had no redundancy for the set of isospectral graphs studied.},

title = {4D-fingerprints, universal QSAR and QSPR descriptors},
abstract = {An elusive goal in the field of chemoinformatics and molecular modeling has been the generation of a set of descriptors that, once calculated for a molecule, may be used in a wide variety of applications. Since such universal descriptors are generated free from external constraints, they are inherently independent of the data set in which they are employed. The realization of a set of universal descriptors would significantly streamline such chemoinformatics tasks as virtual high-throughout screening (VHTS) and toxicity profiling. The current study reports the derivation and validation of a potential set of universal descriptors, referred to as the 4D-fingerprints. The 4D-fingerprints are derived from the 4D-molecular similarity analysis. To evaluate the applicability of the 4D-fingerprints as universal descriptors, they are used to generate descriptive QSAR models for 5 independent training sets. Each of the training sets has been analyzed previously by several varying QSAR methods, and the results of the models generated using the 4D-fingerprints are compared to the results of the previous QSAR analyses. It was found that the models generated using the 4D-fingerprints are comparable in quality, based on statistical measures of fit and test set prediction, to the previously reported models for the other QSAR methods. This finding is particularly significant considering the 4D-fingerprints are generated independent of external constraints such as alignment, while the QSAR methods used for comparison all require an alignment analysis.

title = {Comparison of conformational analysis techniques to generate pharmacophore hypotheses using catalyst},
abstract = {Generation of reliable pharmacophore models is a key strategy in drug design. The quality of a pharmacophore model is known to depend on several factors, with the quality of the conformer sets used perhaps being one of the most important. The goal of this study was to compare different conformational analysis methods to determine if one was superior to the others for pharmacophore generation using Catalyst/HypoGen. The five methods selected were Catalyst/Fast, Catalyst/Best, Omega, Chem-X and MacroModel. Data sets for which Catalysts models had previously been published were selected using defined quality measures. hypotheses were generated for each of the data sets and the performance of the different conformational analysis methods was compared using both quantitative (cost and correlation coefficients) and qualitative measures (by comparing the hypotheses in terms of the features present and their spatial relationships). Two main conclusions emerged from the study. First, it was not always possible to replicate the literature results. The reasons for these failures are explored in detail, and a template for use in publications that apply the Catalyst methodology is proposed. Second, the faster rule-based methods for conformational analysis give pharmacophore models that are just as g, a good as, and in some cases better than, the models generated using the slower, more rigorous approaches.

In addition, it identifies constitutionally equivalent and stereochemically equivalent atoms within a molecule. For molecules with centers of asymmetry, it also identifies whether or not a molecule is chiral. This algorithm has recently been extended to produce all the maps of an organic structure to itself, with and without stereochemical considerations. In addition, an efficiency measure has been introduced for such algorithms. The algorithm was fairly efficient; for example, all the maps of buckminsterfullerane to itself were obtained under 225 s of execution time on a 75 MHz Pentium computer with an efficiency rating of 3.125%.},

abstract = {If a computer-assisted primary structure elucidation expert system is to tackle structural problems of real-world complexity, it must be to cope with the ubiquitous ambiguous 2D NMR correlation information, especially the ambiguous-node(signal or atom)-involved (topological) distance constraints (ANDCs). Such ambiguities of the distance constraints result typically from spectral imperfections and molecular symmetry. As a significant improvement of CISOC-SES, an expert system that automatically deduces the constitutional structure for unknown organic compounds from their molecular formula and conventional one- and two-dimensional NMR spectral information, this paper reports our novel approaches to the representation and use of ambiguous distance constraints for this purpose. The high performance the improved CISOC-SES is demonstrated by the structure elucidation of alborixin from its molecular formula (C48H84O14) and H-1, C-13, COSY, HMQC, HMBC, and NOESY spectral data.

We use the term virtual facility to describe a real NMR facility made accessible via the Internet. The VNMRF combines secure remote operation of the EMSL's NMR spectrometers over the Internet with real-time videoconferencing, remotely controlled laboratory cameras, real-time computer display sharing, a Web-based electronic laboratory notebook, and other capabilities. Remote VNMRF users can see and converse with EMSL researchers, directly and securely control the EMSL spectrometers, and collaboratively analyze results. A customized Electronic Laboratory Notebook allows interactive Web-based access to group notes, experimental parameters, proposed molecular structures, and other aspects of a research project. This paper describes our experience developing a VNMRF and details the specific capabilities available through the EMSL VNMRF, We show how the VNMRF has evolved during a test project and present an evaluation of its impact in the EMSL and its potential as a model for other scientific facilities.

title = {Spin label EPR-based characterization of biosystem complexity},
abstract = {Following the widely spread EPR spin-label applications for biosystem characterization, a novel approach is proposed for EPR-based characterization of biosystem complexity. Hereto a computational method based on a hybrid evolutionary optimization (HEO) is introduced. The enormous volume of information obtained from multiple HEO runs is reduced with a novel so-called GHOST condensation method for automatic detection of the degree of system complexity through the construction of two-dimensional solution distributions. The GHOST method shows the ability of automatic quantitative characterization of groups of solutions, e.g. the determination of average spectral parameters and group contributions. The application of the GHOST condensation algorithm is demonstrated on four synthetic examples of different complexity and applied to two physiologically relevant examples - the determination of domains in biomembranes (lateral heterogeneity) and the study of the low-resolution structure of membrane proteins.

It substitutes the widely used fragment assembly technique and exploits prospectively and simultaneously any kind of analytical data. This was accomplished by the expression of a structure generation problem in terms of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). The CSP techniques such as constraint propagation, intelligent backtracking, and ordered searching have to be efficient for accelerating the generation process. The implementation of the underlying concepts relies on object-oriented formalism. [References: 32]},

For this purpose, X-PERT [Elyashberg et al., Anal. Chim. Acta 337 (1997) 265; 348 (1997) 443] system was employed in this paper. It was found that the system is capable of suggesting all molecular formulae from a given molecular mass and of rejecting the ones. The screening of molecular formulae is carried out by the verification of molecular structures generated on the basis of calculated molecular formulae. The structures are tested for conformity to the spectral data and additional It was found that the C-13 NMR spectrometry can frequently be employed an universal tool for determining both molecular and structural of organic compounds. The approach is illustrated by a series of examples. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. [References: 12]},

title = {PowerMV: A software environment for molecular viewing, descriptor generation, data analysis and hit evaluation},
abstract = {Ideally, a team of biologists, medicinal chemists and information specialists will evaluate the hits from high throughput screening. In practice, it often falls to nonmedicinal chemists to make the initial evaluation of HTS hits. Chemical genetics and high content screening both rely on screening in cells or animals where the biological tar-et may not be known. There is a need to place active compounds into a context to suggest potential biological mechanisms. Our idea is to build an operating environment to help the biologist make the initial evaluation of HTS data. To this end the operating environment provides viewing of compound structure files, computation of basic biologically relevant chemical properties and searching against biologically annotated chemical Structure databases. The benefit is to help the nonmedicinal chemist, biologist and statistician put compunds into a potentially informative biological context. Although there are several similar public and private programs used in the pharmaceutical industry to help evaluate hits, these programs are often built for computational chemists. Our program is designed for use by biologists and statisticians. [References: 19]},

Among them, the biased Monte Carlo schemes exhibit particularly high efficiency in locating optimal compounds. The Monte Carlo strategies are compared to a genetic algorithm approach. Although the best compounds identified by the genetic algorithm are comparable to those from the better Monte Carlo schemes, the diversity of favorable compounds identified is reduced by roughly 60%.

Parameters related to linear correlation plots of computed versus experimental C-13 NMR chemical shifts for fourteen low-polar natural products, containing 10-20 carbon atoms, were employed to assess the reliability of the proposed structures. A comparison with the hybrid B3LYP method was carried out to evaluate electron correlation contributions to the calculation of C-13 NMR chemical shifts and, eventually, to extend the applicability of such computational methods to the interpretation of NMR spectra in apolar solutions. The method was tested by studying three examples of revised structure assignments, analyzing how the theoretical C-13 chemical shifts of both correct and incorrect structures matched the experimental data.

title = {Establishing reporting standards for metabolomic and metabonomic studies: A call for participation},
abstract = {Metabolite concentrations in cellular systems are very much dependent on the physiological, environmental, and genetic status of an organism and are regarded as the ultimate result of cellular regulation, resulting in the visible phenotypes. Therefore, the comprehensive analysis of metabolite levels and fluxes renders a suitable tool for assessing the degree of perturbation in biological systems. Lessons derived from development of other OMICS areas (genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics) have shown that large-scale comparisons and interpretations will require the re-use of data over long periods of time and by multiple laboratories with different expertise and backgrounds. Reaching this goal will require standardization of reporting structures of metabolomic studies for journal publication purposes, for regulatory deposition, and for database dissemination. An initiative by the Metabolomics Society is presented that aims to define important aspects of metabolomic workflows. These include biological study designs, chemical analysis, and data processing, as well as the ontologies that are necessary in this framework.This paper is part of the special issue of OMICS on data standards.},

Instead of concentrating solely on the best solutions proposed by the algorithm, the quality criteria also consider the repeatability of the optimization and the coverage of the search space. They are tested by using various parameter settings of a genetic algorithm providing starting structures for molecular mechanic calculations of organic molecules. These or similar criteria can also be used for other domains of optimization with evolutionary algorithms.},

We assign to every graph the compactness index rho, which is a measure of density of graphs and binary matrices. This index takes values rho > 1 for dense graphs and rho < 1 for sparse graphs (matrices). The index is derived from the quotient of the relative graph density and the percentage of zero entries in the adjacency matrix. The numerical values for the compactness index are reported for miscellaneous graphs, including several families of structurally related graphs.},

This kind of experiment suffers from offset-dependent effects of the 180degrees (C-13) pulses. Here we describe an application of smoothed chirp pulses in the ADEQUATE pulse sequence which allows C-13,C-13 correlations to be run without any offset dependences. This experiment is called chirp ADEQUATE and was applied to delta-valerolactone and cholesteryl acetate. This modification will allow a general application of the ADEQUATE pulse sequence.

abstract = {A new method for spectrum prediction is presented permitting incorporation of stereochemical features, which highly improves the quality of the obtained chemical shift values. The method is based on comparison of the query-structure with a reference library of ring skeletons, so that stereochemical interactions can be counted. The number of stereochemical interactions obtained over a five-bond sphere is used to produce a three-dimensional HOSE-code leading to a more accurate spectrum prediction. The advantages of this new concept will be discussed using examples from natural product chemistry. [References: 5]},

abstract = {From the historically grown archive of protein-ligand complexes in the Protein Data Bank small organic ligands are extracted and interpreted in terms of their chemical characteristics and features. Subsequently, pharmacophores representing ligand-receptor interaction are derived from each of these small molecules and its surrounding amino acids. Based on a defined set of only six types of chemical features and volume constraints, three-dimensional pharmacophore models are constructed, which are sufficiently selective to identify the described binding mode and are thus a useful tool for in-silico screening of large compound databases. The algorithms for ligand extraction and interpretation as well as the pharmacophore creation technique from the automatically interpreted data are presented and applied to a rhinovirus capsid complex as application example.

title = {An effective topological symmetry perception and unique numbering algorithm},
abstract = {Determination of equivalence classes of atoms in molecules and the unique numbering for the molecular graphs are of major interest for many structure processing tasks and many programs have been reported for this purpose. Most of them were based on the use of graph invariants, but such methods reportedly failed to give correct partitioning for certain structures and the only theoretically rigorous method is based on atom-by-atom matchings(1) which was considered to be computationally impractical. In order to avoid the failures of partitioning and the time-consuming atom- by-atom matching, on the basis of a profound analysis on the mechanism of Morgan algorithm, this work proposed two improvements for the original Morgan algorithm. The first improvement is to avoid the oscillatory behavior of Morgan algorithm. The second improvement referred to as single-vertex Morgan algorithm, is to decompose the Morgan algorithm into single-vertex processing. By incorporating these improvements, an effective topological symmetry perception and unique numbering algorithms were devised. The high performance of these algorithms is demonstrated with some graphs that are difficult to partition.},

title = {Similarity searching of chemical databases using atom environment descriptors (MOLPRINT 2D): Evaluation of performance},
abstract = {A molecular similarity searching technique based on atom environments, information-gain-based feature selection, and the naive Bayesian classifier has been applied to a series of diverse datasets and its performance compared to those of alternative searching methods. Atom environments are count vectors of heavy atoms present at a topological distance from each heavy atom of a molecular structure. In this application, using a recently published dataset of more than 100000 molecules from the MDL Drug Data Report database, the atom environment approach appears to outperform fusion of ranking scores as well as binary kernel discrimination, which are both used in combination with Unity fingerprints. Overall retrieval rates among the top 5% of the sorted library are nearly 10% better (more than 14% better in relative numbers) than those of the second best method, Unity fingerprints and binary kernel discrimination. In 10 out of 11 sets of active compounds the combination of atom environments and the naive Bayesian classifier appears to be the superior method, while in the remaining dataset, data fusion and binary kernel discrimination in combination with Unity fingerprints is the method of choice. Binary kernel discrimination in combination with Unity fingerprints generally comes second in performance overall. The difference in performance can largely be attributed to the different molecular descriptors used. Atom environments outperform Unity fingerprints by a large margin if the combination of these descriptors with the Tanimoto coefficient is compared. The naive Bayesian classifier in combination with information-gain-based feature selection and selection of a sensible number of features performs about as well as binary kernel discrimination in experiments where these classification methods are compared. When used on a monoaminooxidase dataset, atom environments and the naive Bayesian classifier perform as well as binary kernel discrimination in the case of a 50/50 split of training and test compounds. In the case of sparse training data, binary kernel discrimination is found to be superior on this particular dataset. On a third dataset, the atom environment descriptor shows higher retrieval rates than other 2D fingerprints tested here when used in combination with the Tanimoto similarity coefficient. Feature selection is shown to be a crucial step in determining the performance of the algorithm. The representation of molecules by atom environments is found to be more effective than Unity fingerprints for the type of biological receptor similarity calculations examined here. Combining information prior to scoring and including information about inactive compounds, as in the Bayesian classifier and binary kernel discrimination, is found to be superior to posterior data fusion (in the datasets tested here).

It is vitally important for these interpretation packages to be robust, and this means that it essential to know how the quality of NMR data varies is real life experiments. A practical test concerning the reproducibility of chemical shift information from recorded C- 13 NMR spectra:was carried out using eight test substances. TWO hundred seventy spectra were contributed from both Academia and Industry and have been subjected to a standardized interpretation. For these spectra the confidence Limits of their chemical shifts have been calculated, The standard deviations found vary from 0.2 up to about 2.5 ppm, and the range of values for the shifts reported vary from +/- 0.7 up to more than +/-7 ppm around the respective average shift. Test substances recorded in more polar solvents generally showed higher standard deviations and also exhibit a dependency of the deviation on the chemical shift value.},

The algorithm is based on the classical scheme of a drawing queue placing the molecular fragments in a sequential way. We extend the concept of so-called prefabricated units developed for complex ring systems to automatically created drawing units for chains and rings which will then be assembled in a sequential fashion. The approach is fast and can be naturally extended to the problem of drawing molecules with common core structures. Further on, we present an algorithm that allows the drawing of 2D structural formulas under directional constraints assigned to a subset of bonds. Since no numerical optimization is necessary, the algorithm creates drawings of small organic molecules on the order of 500 structures per second. The new algorithm is relevant for all kinds of prediction and analysis software presenting a large number of probably similar molecular structures to the user of the software.},

abstract = {In a database of about 2000 approved drugs, represented by 105 structural conformers, we have performed 2D comparisons (Tanimoto coefficients) and 3D superpositions. For one class of drugs the correlation between structural resemblance and similar action was analyzed in detail. In general Tanimoto coefficients and 3D scores give similar results, but we find that 2D similarity measures neglect important structural/funtional features. Examples for both over- and underestimation of similarity by 2D metrics are discussed. The required additional effort for 3D superpositions is assessed by implementation of a fast algorithm with a processing time below 0.01 s and a more sophisticated approach (0.5 s per superposition). According to the improvement of similarity detection compared to 2D screening and the pleasant rapidity on a desktop PC, full-atom 3D superposition will be an upcoming method of choice for library prioritization or similarity screening approaches.

title = {ADME evaluation in drug discovery. 4. Prediction of aqueous solubility based on atom contribution approach},
abstract = {A novel method for the estimation of aqueous solubility was solely based on simple atom contribution. Each atom in a molecule has its own contribution to aqueous solubility and was developed. Altogether 76 atom types were used to classify atoms with different chemical environments. Moreover, two correction factors, including hydrophobic carbon and square of molecular weight, were used to account for the inter-/ intramolecular hydrophobic interactions and bulkiness effect. The contribution coefficients of different atom types and correction factors were generated based on a multiple linear regression using a learning set consisting of 1290 organic compounds. The obtained linear regression model possesses good statistical significance with an overall correlation coefficient (r) of 0.96, a standard deviation (s) of 0.61, and an unsigned mean error (UME) of 0.48. The actual prediction potential of the model was validated through an external test set with 21 pharmaceutically and environmentally interesting compounds. For the test set, a predictive r = 0.94, s = 0.84, and UME = 0.52 were achieved. Comparisons among eight procedures of solubility calculation for those 21 molecules demonstrate that our model bears very good accuracy and is comparable to or even better than most reported techniques based on molecular descriptors. Moreover, we compared the performance of our model to a test set of 120 molecules with a popular group contribution method developed by Klopman et al. For this test set, our model gives a very effective prediction (r = 0.96, s = 0.79, UME = 0.57), which is obviously superior to the predicted results (r = 0.96, s = 0.84, UME = 0.70) given by the Klopman's group contribution approach. Because of the adoption of atoms as the basic units, our addition model does not contain a "missing fragment" problem and thus may be more simple and universal than the group contribution models and can give predictions for any organic molecules. A program, drug-LOGS, had been developed to identify the occurrence of atom types and estimate the aqueous solubility of a molecule. [References: 31]},

abstract = {The current methods of publishing chemical information in bioscience articles are analysed. Using 3 papers as use-cases, it is shown that conventional methods using human procedures, including cut-and-paste are time-consuming and introduce errors. The meaning of chemical terms and the identity of compounds is often ambiguous. valuable experimental data such as spectra and computational results are almost always omitted. We describe an Open XML architecture at proof-of-concept which addresses these concerns. Compounds are identified through explicit connection tables or links to persistent Open resources such as PubChem. It is argued that if publishers adopt these tools and protocols, then the quality and quantity of chemical information available to bioscientists will increase and the authors, publishers and readers will find the process cost-effective.},

In this representation, only an N component one-dimensional array is needed for inscribing each KVB or longer range RVB structure for an N-carbon system. Based on the adjacency bonding arrays, we develop very efficient algorithms for the systematic search of KVB and RVB structures as well as evaluation of the basis set overlap and Hamiltonian matrices.

title = {New Born radii deriving method for generalized Born model},
abstract = {Here we report a method to calculate Born radii, an important parameter used in a Generalized Born model. Traditional methods to derive Born radii are mostly based on a complicated formula, while our method is easier and more direct. Atoms are classified according to their atom type, and the Born radii of each type are obtained by fitting to experimental solvation free energy. The SMARTS language is used for the exact definition of atoms types, and Ullmann's subgraph isomorphism algorithm is used to deduce the environment. A generic algorithm is used for the parameter fitting because of its efficiency in searching a huge phase space, and its results are then optimized by using the conjugate gradient method. The final parameter set is fitting from a training set containing 357 molecules and is tested using a test set of 44 small organic molecules, and the average error is 0.58 kcal/mol for 36 neutral molecules and is 1.67 kcal/mol for 8 ions. The model is further tested under organic molecules, biopolymers, and a protein-inhibitor complex and yields reliable results in all these cases. This method can be used to accelerate molecular docking calculations. [References: 24]},

abstract = {Most marketed pharmaceuticals consist of molecular crystals. The arrangement of the molecules in a crystal determines its physical properties and, in certain cases, its chemical properties, and so greatly influences the processing and formulation of solid pharmaceuticals, as well as key drug properties such as dissolution rate and stability. A thorough understanding of the relationships between physical structures and the properties of pharmaceutical solids is therefore important in selecting the most suitable form of an active pharmaceutical ingredient for development into a drug product. In this article, we review the different crystal forms of pharmaceuticals, the challenges that they present and recent advances in crystal structure determination. We then discuss computational approaches for predicting crystal properties. Finally, we review the analysis of crystal structures in furthering crystal engineering to design novel pharmaceutical compounds with desired physical and mechanical properties. [References: 190]},

abstract = {A method was developed to yield automatically accurate chemical shirts from peak-pick tables of proton spectra. Not only does this allow the rapid comparison of proton spectra obtained at any external magnetic field strength with spectral databases or calculated chemical shifts, but it also allows the facile building of proton chemical shift databases. The extraction of chemical shifts was successful in many situations of multiplet overlap and second-order coupling. Scalar couplings were also extracted fairly successfully, although the performance was compromised at lower external magnetic field strength and in spectra displaying second-order couplings.

title = {Chemical Similarity Searching},
abstract = {This paper reviews the use of similarity searching in chemical databases. It begins by introducing the concept of similarity searching, differentiating it from the more common substructure searching, and then discusses the current generation of fragment-based measures that are used for searching chemical structure databases. The next sections focus upon two of the principal characteristics of a similarity measure:  the coefficient that is used to quantify the degree of structural resemblance between pairs of molecules and the structural representations that are used to characterize molecules that are being compared in a similarity calculation. New types of similarity measure are then compared with current approaches, and examples are given of several applications that are related to similarity searching.},
