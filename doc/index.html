       <h3>Introduction</h3>
       This page describes
       <b>OrChem</b>, an Oracle chemistry plug-in using the
       <a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/cdk/"> Chemistry Development Kit</a> (CDK). The CDK is an open source Java library for Chemoinformatics and Bioinformatics.
       OrChem originated in the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/steinbeck/">chemoinformatics and metabolism team </a> of the European Bioinformatics Institute.
       <br></br>
       Oracle Data cartridges extend the capabilities of the Oracle server. For
       chemistry various commercial cartridges exist that facilitate
       searching and analyzing chemical data. OrChem also provides 
       functionality like this, but is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> a cartridge. It doesn't need Oracle's
       extensibility architecture because its Java components run as Java stored procedures inside the Oracle standard JVM (Aurora).
       <br></br>
        <b> OrChem is suitable for Oracle 11G and onwards</b>.
       Starting with Oracle 11g release 1 (11.1) there is a just-in-time(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT</a>) 
       compiler for Oracle JVM environment. A
       <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/java.111/b31225/chnine.htm#BABDCIBH">JIT compiler for Oracle JVM</a>
       enables much faster execution because it manages the invalidation,
       recompilation, and storage of code without an external mechanism. This
       new Oracle feature makes it possible to run Java 1.5 classes as well performing Java stored procedures, whereas with earlier Oracle versions
       performance would have been weaker.

       <h3>Overview</h3>
       <img alt="orchem overview" src="orchem_flow.gif"></img>
       <br></br>
       The picture above shows the main components of OrChem in yellow.
       Shown left in gray is the user's table with chemical compounds. This table or
       view must have a single primary key column and an (MDL) molfile Clob. The id and molfile
       column are mandatory for OrChem to work (additional compound storage types will be added).
       During OrChem
       <a href="installation.html">installation</a>
       the table ORCHEM_PARAMETERS is populated; this one-row table
       stores the name of user's compound table and its primary key column. 
       <br></br>
       Before OrChem can be used to search the compound table, a Java stored
       procedure (package "orchem_fingerprinting") needs to run to populate tables that support
       similarity and substructure searching. 
       <br>
       The fingerprinting procedure reads the entire content of user's compound table, and for each 
       compound creates a CDK molecule and fingerprints it. The time it takes for this procedure to complete
       depends on the size of the compound table and the complexity of the compounds. The procedure can/should be
       parallelized, for instance by using DBMS_JOB.
       <br></br>
       The two shown tables ORCHEM_FINGPRINT_SIMSEARCH and ORCHEM_FINGPRINT_SUBSEARCH are the target for the
       fingerprinting procedure:
       <ul>
        <li>
         <span style="font-style:italic;">ORCHEM_FINGPRINT_SIMSEARCH</span>
         is a cached table to facilitate similarity searching. It has a raw
         column storing the fingerprint for each compound. It also has a column
         that indicates how many of the fingerprint bits are set to one.
         OrChem uses a <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/citexplore/citationDetails.do?externalId=17326616&dataSource=MED">
         similarity search algorithm</a> that makes relatively large
         row scans on this table. The similarity table is therefore kept "lean"
         and cached for better performance.
         &nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
         <span style="font-style:italic;">ORCHEM_FINGPRINT_SUBSEARCH</span>
         is the munter table for substructure searching. It has the same chemical
         fingerprint shredded into separate columns, each column representing 
         one bit of the fingerprint (null=false, 1=true).
         There are also columns for storing atom and bond information for the compound the row is linked to. If the 
         compound is big, the atom and bond data may occasionally overflow into Clobs, table ORCHEM_BIG_MOLECULES (not shown)<br>
         The substructure search requires a query's fingerprint to be a subset of
         any candidate's fingerprint. This is implemented by running a pre-filter query on
         the indexed columns bit1 .. bitxxx. <br>Atom and bond <span style="font-style:italic;">counts</span> are used to
         skip compounds that can never be candidates. For example, a query structure with three oxygen atoms can 
         never be a substructure of a compound with two oxygens or less. 
         Filtered candidates are finally put through a CDK <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.101.5342">
         VF2 graph matching </a> implementation to check if the query structure really is a substructure of the pre-filtered candidate compound.<br></br>
        </li>
       </ul>
         OrChem substructure searching is generally more expensive and slower than similarity searching because it includes the costly graph matching step. 
         To boost performance, Oracle's <A href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/appdev.102/b14289/dcitblfns.htm">parallel piped function</a> feature has been implemented for the substructure search.
         The user can actually choose between parallelized and  non-parallelized substructure searches (see the two 'subsearch' packages in the picture).
         The parallel search requires an extra step making the query a two-step process. Although this is slightly annoying overhead,
         the benefit may be serious performance gain, depending on the query and the amount of cores/processors on your database server.
      <br><br><br>
      You can of course opt out of the OrChem search implementations.
      Instead, you could only install the Java libraries in a database schema and so have the CDK at your disposal inside Oracle.
      You can build Java stored procedure wrappers around CDK class methods of your particular interest. 
      This is a relatively straightforward process, and once in place the rich functionality of the CDK is available to all SQL and PL/SQL in your database applications.
