            <ul>
              <li>
                This page describes how to set up OrChem in an Oracle Database. It is assumed that you have some
                knowledge of Oracle, that you have a working Oracle client installed (sqlplus, loadjava) and that you
                have a schema with chemical compounds, including a molfile CLOB for each compound.
                <br></br>
                Once installed, OrChem provides similarity and substructure searching against your compound table.
              </li>
              <li>OrChem has been developed and tested for Oracle Database 11G. Previous versions of the Oracle database
                  do not support the current CDK's version.</li>
              <li>The installation of OrChem requires the creation of a dedicated user account (schema).
                  With the schema in place, OrChem tables can be created, followed by the loading of required JAR files,
                  and running a Java class to populate the OrChem tables. The installation is partly done through
                  convenient scripts.</li>
              <li>The duration of the installation process depends mainly on the size of your compound table and the
                  speed of your hardware. In house at the EBI, the OrChem installation against the Chembl compound
                  database (xx compounds) takes about .. hours (using parallel loading)</li>
