       The picture below shows the main components of OrChem in yellow.
       Shown left in gray is the user's table with chemical compounds. This table or
       view must have a single primary key column and an (MDL) molfile Clob. The id and molfile
       column are mandatory for OrChem to work (additional compound storage types will be added).
       During OrChem
       <a href="installation.html">installation</a>
       the table ORCHEM_PARAMETERS is populated; this one-row table
       stores the name of user's compound table and its primary key column. 
       <br></br>
       Before OrChem can be used to search the compound table, a Java stored
       procedure (package "orchem_fingerprinting") needs to run to populate tables that support
       similarity and substructure searching. 
       <br>
       The fingerprinting procedure reads the entire content of user's compound table, and for each 
       compound creates a CDK molecule and fingerprints it. The time it takes for this procedure to complete
       depends on the size of the compound table and the complexity of the compounds. The procedure can/should be
       parallelized, for instance by using DBMS_JOB.
       <br></br>
       The two shown tables ORCHEM_FINGPRINT_SIMSEARCH and ORCHEM_FINGPRINT_SUBSEARCH are populated by the
       fingerprinting procedure:
       <ul>
        <li>
         <span style="font-style:italic;">ORCHEM_FINGPRINT_SIMSEARCH</span>
         is a cached table that facilitates similarity searching. It has a raw
         column storing the fingerprint for each compound. It also has a column
         that indicates how many of the fingerprint bits are set to one.
         OrChem uses a <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/citexplore/citationDetails.do?externalId=17326616&dataSource=MED">
         similarity search algorithm</a> that makes relatively large
         row scans on this table. The similarity table is therefore kept "lean"
         and cached for better performance.
         &nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
         <span style="font-style:italic;">ORCHEM_FINGPRINT_SUBSEARCH</span>
         is the central table for substructure searching. It has the same chemical
         fingerprint shredded into separate columns, each column representing 
         one bit of the fingerprint (null=false, 1=true).
         There are also columns for storing atom and bond information for the compound the row is linked to. If the 
         compound is big, the atom and bond data may occasionally overflow into Clobs, table ORCHEM_BIG_MOLECULES (not shown)<br>
         The substructure search requires a query's fingerprint to be a subset of
         any candidate's fingerprint. This is implemented by running a pre-filter query on
         the indexed columns bit1 .. bitxxx. <br>Atom and bond <span style="font-style:italic;">counts</span> are used to
         skip compounds that can never be candidates. For example, a query structure with three oxygen atoms can 
         never be a substructure of a compound with two oxygens or less. 
         Filtered candidates are finally put through a CDK <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.101.5342">
         VF2 graph matching </a> implementation to check if the query structure really is a substructure of the pre-filtered candidate compound.<br></br>
        </li>
       </ul>
         OrChem substructure searching is generally more expensive and slower than similarity searching because it includes the costly graph matching step. 
         To boost performance, Oracle's <A href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/appdev.102/b14289/dcitblfns.htm">parallel piped function</a> feature has been implemented for the substructure search.
         The user can actually choose between parallelized and  non-parallelized substructure searches (see the two 'subsearch' packages in the picture).
         The parallel search requires an extra step making the query a two-step process. Although this is extra overhead,
         the benefit may be serious performance gain, depending on the query and the amount of cores/processors on your database server.
      <br><br><br>
      You can opt out of OrChem's search implementations; instead, you could only install the Java libraries in a database schema and so have 
      the CDK at your disposal inside Oracle. A number of chemical format conversion functions
      have been set up for your convenience, and developers can build additional Java stored procedure wrappers around CDK class methods of your particular interest. 
      This is a relatively straightforward process, and once in place the rich functionality of the CDK is available to all SQL and PL/SQL in your database applications.
