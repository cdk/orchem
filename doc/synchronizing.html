            <h3>Keeping fingerprints in sync with your compound data</h3>

            After installing OrChem and creating the initial fingerprints, 
            these fingerprints will get out of date over time if your
            compound data changes after inserts, deletes and updates.
            OrChem provides a simple mechanism that can be used to periodically
            synchronize the compounds with the fingerprint, the details are
            described on this page.

            <h3>Set up</h3>

            The synchronization concept is pretty straightforward: a CRUD trigger is created on
            your compound base table and each change is then logged in an audit table
            specifically for OrChem. Periodically (at the interval you want), you then
            schedule an OrChem procedure to inspect the audit table, update the fingerprints
            based on the audit table content and remove processed audit data.
            <BR>
            This differs a little bit from the general installation that was done 
            in its own "ORCHEM" schema. The trigger and audit table must be 
            installed in the 'master' schema that owns the compound table.
            <P>
            <UL>
            <li>Navigate into the orchem/sql directory where you unzipped OrChem</li>
            <li>Connect to the database using SQL*Plus with your account that <b>owns the compound table.</b></li>
            <li>In SQL*Plus, execute the script <b>synchronization.sql</b>, located in orchem/sql. 
                This script first creates the audit table and then asks you for the compound table name and the name 
                of the primary key column. It then creates a trigger on your compound table.<br>
                Example below, where a trigger is created on compound table 'ORCHEM_COMPOUND_SAMPLE' which
                has a primary key column called 'ID'.
<pre>
        SQL> @synchronization
        
        drop table orchem_audit_compound_changes (if exists)
        Table dropped.
        
        creating table orchem_audit_compound_changes
        Table created.

        
        creating trigger 'orchem_trg_compound_changes'

        Enter value for your_compound_table: ORCHEM_COMPOUND_SAMPLE
        Enter value for your_primary_key: ID
        
        Trigger created.
        
        No errors.

        SQL>
        SQL>
</pre>

            </li>
            <li>With the creation of the trigger, changes on the compound table will be logged in 
            a new audit table called "orchem_audit_compound_changes".
            The OrChem user needs to be given privileges in order to use this audit table.
            The privilege is given with a GRANT command. <br><br>
            Like the previous script, the GRANT needs to run by the account that <b>owns</b> the compound table (and the
            newly created audit table). You can copy/paste/execute the example below, assuming your OrChem account is 
            actually called "ORCHEM"; otherwise you have to change the last word, the grantee.
<pre>

        SQL> grant select,insert, update, delete on orchem_audit_compound_changes to orchem;

        Grant succeeded.



</pre>            
            
            </li>
            <li>Now <b>reconnect</b> to the database using SQL*Plus with your account ORCHEM account instead.</li>
            <li>To finalize the setup, OrChem needs to create a private synonym for the audit table. This
            makes it possible for Orchem to refer to the audit table without a schema prefix. <br>
            You can use the example below, replacing xxx with the name of the schema in which you 
            just created the audit table. If you don't have the privilege to create synonyms, you'll get 
            an error (so go and bug your DBA)
<pre>

        SQL>  create synonym orchem_audit_compound_changes for xxxx.orchem_audit_compound_changes;
        
        Synonym created.
</pre>
            </li>
            <li>This complete the synchronization set up.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Running the synchronization</h3>

            Synchronization is invoked by calling package "orchem_fingerprinting",
            procedure "synchronize_cdk_fingerprints". An example is given below,
            in this case the procedure returns immediately because there was nothing to do 
            (the audit table was empty).<br>
<pre>

SQL> exec orchem_fingerprinting.SYNCHRONIZE_CDK_FINGERPRINTS

Nothing to do !!
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

            You may want to <b>schedule</b> this procedure regularly, 
            depending on the volatility of you compound data. For such scheduling you
            could use the standard facility DBMS_JOB. Or you could run it each time
            after you update/load compounds in some batch job. It's up to you.
